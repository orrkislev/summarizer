The Gift // Lewis Hyde // 1983 		
At the corner drugstore my neighbors and I can now buy a line of romantic novels written according to a formula developed through market research. An advertising agency polled a group of women readers. What age should the heroine be? (She should be between nineteen and twenty-seven.) Should the man she meets be married or single? (Recently widowed is best.) The hero and heroine are not allowed in bed together until they are married. Each novel is 192 pages long. Even the name of the series and the design of the cover have been tailored to the demands of the market. (The name Silhouette was preferred over Belladonna, Surrender, Tiffany, and Magnolia; gold curlicues were chosen to frame the cover.) Six new titles appear each month and two hundred thousand copies of each title are printed.	A series of romantic novels sold at a local drugstore are written based on market research. The research determined the characters' age, marital status, and even the length of the book. The series' name and cover design were also chosen based on consumer preferences. 	Market Research Dictates Romantic Novels
Why do we suspect that Silhouette Romances will not be enduring works of art? What is it about a work of art, even when it is bought and sold in the market, that makes us distinguish it from such pure commodities as these? It is the assumption of this book that a work of art is a gift, not a commodity. Or, to state the modern case with more precision, that works of art exist simultaneously in two “economies,” a market economy and a gift economy. Only one of these is essential, however: a work of art can survive without the market, but where there is no gift there is no art.	The book argues that a work of art is fundamentally a gift, not a commodity. While art can exist in both a market economy and a gift economy, its true essence is tied to the latter. Art can survive without the market, but without the element of a gift, it ceases to be art.	Art as a Gift, Not a Commodity
There are several distinct senses of “gift” that lie behind these ideas, but common to each of them is the notion that a gift is a thing we do not get by our own efforts. We cannot buy it; we cannot acquire it through an act of will. It is bestowed upon us. Thus we rightly speak of “talent” as a “gift,” for although a talent can be perfected through an effort of the will, no effort in the world can cause its initial appearance. Mozart, composing on the harpsichord at the age of four, had a gift.	Art is fundamentally linked to the concept of a "gift", something bestowed upon us, not acquired or bought. This is exemplified in talents, like Mozart's musical abilities, which emerge naturally and are beyond our control.	Art as a Gift
We also rightly speak of intuition or inspiration as a gift. As the artist works, some portion of his creation is bestowed upon him. An idea pops into his head, a tune begins to play, a phrase comes to mind, a color falls in place on the canvas. Usually, in fact, the artist does not find himself engaged or exhilarated by the work, nor does it seem authentic, until this gratuitous element has appeared, so that along with any true creation comes the uncanny sense that “I,” the artist, did not make the work. “Not I, not I, but the wind that blows through me,” says D. H. Lawrence. Not all artists emphasize the “gift” phase of their creations to the degree that Lawrence does, but all artists feel it.	Artistic inspiration is often seen as a "gift" that spontaneously appears during the creative process, bringing authenticity and exhilaration. It feels as if it comes through the artist, rather than from them.	The Gift of Artistic Inspiration
These two senses of gift refer only to the creation of the work—what we might call the inner life of art; but it is my assumption that we should extend this way of speaking to its outer life as well, to the work after it has left its maker’s hands. That art that matters to us—which moves the heart, or revives the soul, or delights the senses, or offers courage for living, however we choose to describe the experience—that work is received by us as a gift is received. Even if we have paid a fee at the door of the museum or concert hall, when we are touched by a work of art something comes to us which has nothing to do with the price. I went to see a landscape painter’s works, and that evening, walking among pine trees near my home, I could see the shapes and colors I had not seen the day before. The spirit of an artist’s gifts can wake our own. The work appeals, as Joseph Conrad says, to a part of our being which is itself a gift and not an acquisition. Our sense of harmony can hear the harmonies that Mozart heard. We may not have the power to profess our gifts as the artist does, and yet we come to recognize, and in a sense to receive, the endowments of our being through the agency of his creation. We feel fortunate, even redeemed. The daily commerce of our lives—“sugar for sugar and salt for salt,” as the blues singers say—proceeds at its own constant level, but a gift revives the soul. When we are moved by art we are grateful that the artist lived, grateful that he labored in the service of his gifts.	Art has the power to move us, to change our perception, and to awaken our own creativity. This transformative experience is received as a gift, separate from any monetary transaction. The artist's work touches a part of us that is a gift in itself, not an acquisition. This interaction revives the soul and makes us grateful for the artist's existence and their dedication to their craft.	The Transformative Power of Art
If a work of art is the emanation of its maker’s gift and if it is received by its audience as a gift, then is it, too, a gift? I have framed the question to imply an affirmative answer, but I doubt we can be so categorical. Any object, any item of commerce, becomes one kind of property or another depending on how we use it. Even if a work of art contains the spirit of the artist’s gift, it does not follow that the work itself is a gift. It is what we make of it.	Art embodies the artist's gift and can be received as a gift by the audience. However, whether it's considered a gift or a commodity depends on our interaction and interpretation of it.	Gift or Commodity?
And yet, that said, it must be added that the way we treat a thing can sometimes change its nature. For example, religions often prohibit the sale of sacred objects, the implication being that their sanctity is lost if they are bought and sold. A work of art seems to be a hardier breed; it can be sold in the market and still emerge a work of art. But if it is true that in the essential commerce of art a gift is carried by the work from the artist to his audience, if I am right to say that where there is no gift there is no art, then it may be possible to destroy a work of art by converting it into a pure commodity. Such, at any rate, is my position. I do not maintain that art cannot be bought and sold; I do maintain that the gift portion of the work places a constraint upon our merchandising.	While art can be bought and sold without losing its essence, the inherent gift within it imposes a limit on its commercialization. The transformation of art into a pure commodity may risk destroying its artistic value.	The Delicate Balance of Art as a Gift and Commodity
The particular form that my elaboration of these ideas has taken may best be introduced through a description of how I came to my topic in the first place. For some years now I myself have tried to make my way as a poet, a translator, and a sort of “scholar without institution.” Inevitably the money question comes up; labors such as mine are notoriously non-remunerative, and the landlord is not interested in your book of translations the day the rent falls due. A necessary corollary seems to follow the proposition that a work of art is a gift: there is nothing in the labor of art itself that will automatically make it pay. Quite the opposite, in fact. I develop this point at some length in the chapters that follow, so I shall not elaborate upon it here except to say that every modern artist who has chosen to labor with a gift must sooner or later wonder how he or she is to survive in a society dominated by market exchange. And if the fruits of a gift are gifts themselves, how is the artist to nourish himself, spiritually as well as materially, in an age whose values are market values and whose commerce consists almost exclusively in the purchase and sale of commodities?	 Artists, who often work in the realm of gifts rather than commodities, face a unique challenge in a society dominated by market exchange. The question arises of how they can sustain themselves materially and spiritually in an environment where the primary values are market values and commerce is largely based on the buying and selling of commodities.	The Artist's Dilemma: Balancing Art and Survival in a Market Economy
Every culture offers its citizens an image of what it is to be a man or woman of substance. There have been times and places in which a person came into his or her social being through the dispersal of his gifts, the “big man” or “big woman” being that one through whom the most gifts flowed. The mythology of a market society reverses the picture: getting rather than giving is the mark of a substantial person, and the hero is “self-possessed,” “self-made.” So long as these assumptions rule, a disquieting sense of triviality, of worthlessness even, will nag the man or woman who labors in the service of a gift and whose products are not adequately described as commodities. Where we reckon our substance by our acquisitions, the gifts of the gifted man are powerless to make him substantial.	Society's perception of a person of substance has shifted from being the one through whom the most gifts flowed, to the one who acquires the most. This shift can leave those who labor in the service of a gift, such as artists, feeling trivial and worthless, as their work doesn't fit the commodity-focused narrative of a market society.	Giving vs. Acquiring in Society
Moreover, as I shall argue in my opening chapters, a gift that cannot be given away ceases to be a gift. The spirit of a gift is kept alive by its constant donation. If this is the case, then the gifts of the inner world must be accepted as gifts in the outer world if they are to retain their vitality. Where gifts have no public currency, therefore, where the gift as a form of property is neither recognized nor honored, our inner gifts will find themselves excluded from the very commerce which is their nourishment. Or, to say the same thing from a different angle, where commerce is exclusively a traffic in merchandise, the gifted cannot enter into the give-and-take that ensures the livelihood of their spirit.	Gifts maintain their vitality through constant giving. In a society that doesn't recognize non-material gifts, individuals with such gifts struggle to participate in the commerce that nourishes their spirit.	The Vitality of Gifts
These two lines of thought—the idea of art as a gift and the problem of the market—did not converge for me until I began to read through the work that has been done in anthropology on gifts as a kind of property and gift exchange as a kind of commerce. Many tribal groups circulate a large portion of their material wealth as gifts. Tribesmen are typically enjoined from buying and selling food, for example; even though there may be a strong sense of “mine and thine,” food is always given as a gift and the transaction is governed by the ethics of gift exchange, not those of barter or cash purchase. Not surprisingly, people live differently who treat a portion of their wealth as a gift. To begin with, unlike the sale of a commodity, the giving of a gift tends to establish a relationship between the parties involved.* Furthermore, when gifts circulate within a group, their commerce leaves a series of interconnected relationships in its wake, and a kind of decentralized cohesiveness emerges. There are, as we shall see, five or six related observations of this kind that can be made about a commerce of gifts, and in reading through the anthropological literature I began to realize that a description of gift exchange might offer me the language, the way of speaking, through which I could address the situation of creative artists. And since anthropology tends not to concern itself so much with inner gifts, I soon widened my reading to include all the folk tales I could find involving gifts. Folk wisdom does not differ markedly from tribal wisdom in its sense of what a gift is and does, but folk tales are told in a more interior language: the gifts in fairy tales may, at one level, refer to real property, but at another they are images in the psyche and their story describes for us a spiritual or psychological commerce. In fact, although I offer many accounts of gift exchange in the real world, my hope is that these accounts, too, can be read at several levels, that the real commerce they tell about stands witness to the invisible commerce through which the gifted come to profess their gifts, and we to receive them.	In many tribal societies, material wealth is circulated as gifts, establishing relationships and creating a decentralized cohesiveness. Folk tales also reflect this concept of gift exchange, often symbolizing spiritual or psychological commerce. This understanding of gift exchange can provide insights into the situation of creative artists and the reception of their gifts.	Gift Exchange in Tribal Societies and Folk Tales
The classic work on gift exchange is Marcel Mauss’s “Essai sur le don,” published in France in 1924. The nephew of Émile Durkheim, a Sanskrit scholar, a gifted linguist, and a historian of religions, Mauss belongs to that group of early sociologists whose work is firmly rooted in philosophy and history. His essay begins with the field reports of turn-of-the-century ethnographers (Franz Boas, Bronislaw Malinowski, and Elsdon Best, in particular), but goes on to cover the Roman laws of real estate, a Hindu epic, Germanic dowry customs, and much more. The essay has proved to hold several enduring insights. Mauss noticed, for one thing, that gift economies tend to be marked by three related obligations: the obligation to give, the obligation to accept, and the obligation to reciprocate. He also pointed out that we should understand gift exchange to be a “total social phenomenon”—one whose transactions are at once economic, juridical, moral, aesthetic, religious, and mythological, and whose meaning cannot, therefore, be adequately described from the point of view of any single discipline.	Marcel Mauss, a renowned sociologist, highlighted the complexity of gift exchange in his work "Essai sur le don". He identified three obligations in gift economies: to give, to accept, and to reciprocate. He also emphasized that gift exchange is a "total social phenomenon", encompassing economic, juridical, moral, aesthetic, religious, and mythological aspects, and thus cannot be fully understood from a single disciplinary perspective.	Marcel Mauss and the Total Social Phenomenon of Gift Exchange
Almost every anthropologist who has addressed himself to questions of exchange in the last half century has taken Mauss’s essay as his point of departure. Many names come to mind, including Raymond Firth and Claude Lévi-Strauss, but in my estimation the most interesting recent work has been done by Marshall Sahlins, an economic anthropologist at the University of Chicago. Sahlins’s 1972 Stone Age Economics, in particular, contains an excellent chapter on “The Spirit of the Gift,” which applies a rigorous explication de texte to part of the source material upon which Mauss based his essay, and goes on to place Mauss’s ideas in the history of political philosophy. It was through Sahlins’s writings that I first began to see the possibility of my own work, and I am much indebted to him.	Marshall Sahlins, an economic anthropologist, has expanded on Marcel Mauss's work on gift exchange. His book, "Stone Age Economics", provides a detailed analysis of gift exchange, placing it within a broader political and philosophical context. His work has significantly shaped modern understanding of this concept.	Marshall Sahlins and the Spirit of the Gift
The primary work on gift exchange has been done in anthropology not, it seems to me, because gifts are a primitive or aboriginal form of property—they aren’t—but because gift exchange tends to be an economy of small groups, of extended families, small villages, close-knit communities, brotherhoods and, of course, of tribes. During the last decade a second discipline has turned to the study of gifts, and for a second reason. Medical sociologists have been drawn to questions of gift exchange because they have come to understand that the ethics of gift giving make it a form of commerce appropriate to the transfer of what we might call “sacred properties,” in this case parts of the human body. The earliest work in this field was done by Richard Titmuss, a British professor of social administration, who, in 1971, published The Gift Relationship, a study of how we handle the human blood that is to be used for transfusions. Titmuss compares the British system, which classifies all blood as a gift, with the American, a mixed economy in which some blood is donated and some is bought and sold. Since Titmuss’s work appeared, our increasing ability to transplant actual body organs, kidneys in particular, has led to several books on the ethics and complexities of “the gift of life.”	Medical sociologists have begun studying gift exchange due to its relevance in the transfer of "sacred properties" like human body parts. Richard Titmuss's work, "The Gift Relationship", compares the British system of blood donation, where all blood is considered a gift, with the American system, which is a mix of donations and purchases. This field of study has expanded with the increasing ability to transplant body organs, leading to discussions on the ethics of giving "the gift of life".	Gift Exchange in Medical Sociology: The Case of Blood and Organ Donation
Even such a brief précis of the work that has been done on gift exchange should make it clear that we still lack a comprehensive theory of gifts. Mauss’s work remains our only general statement, and even that, as its title tells us, is an essay, a collection of initial observations with proposals for further study. Most of the work since Mauss has concerned itself with specific topics—in anthropology, law, ethics, medicine, public policy, and so forth. My own work is no exception. The first half of this book is a theory of gift exchange and the second is an attempt to apply the language of that theory to the life of the artist. Clearly, the concerns of the second half were the guide to my reading and theorizing in the first. I touch on many issues, but I pass over many others in silence. With two or three brief exceptions I do not, for example, take up the negative side of gift exchange—gifts that leave an oppressive sense of obligation, gifts that manipulate or humiliate, gifts that establish and maintain hierarchies, and so forth and so on.* This is partly a matter of priority (it has seemed to me that a description of the value and power of gifts must precede an explication of their misuse), but it is mostly a matter of my subject. I have hoped to write an economy of the creative spirit: to speak of the inner gift that we accept as the object of our labor, and the outer gift that has become a vehicle of culture. I am not concerned with gifts given in spite or fear, nor those gifts we accept out of servility or obligation; my concern is the gift we long for, the gift that, when it comes, speaks commandingly to the soul and irresistibly moves us.	While comprehensive theories of gift exchange are lacking, the concept is explored in various fields such as anthropology, law, ethics, and medicine. This work focuses on the positive aspects of gift exchange, particularly in the context of artistic creation. It explores the inner gift that fuels our labor and the outer gift that drives culture, excluding gifts given out of negative emotions or obligation. The focus is on the gifts that deeply resonate with us and compel us to action.	The Economy of the Creative Spirit
 A Theory of Gifts, Chatper 1: Some Food We Could Not Eat 		
When the Puritans first landed in Massachusetts, they discovered a thing so curious about the Indians’ feelings for property that they felt called upon to give it a name. In 1764, when Thomas Hutchinson wrote his history of the colony, the term was already an old saying: “An Indian gift,” he told his readers, “is a proverbial expression signifying a present for which an equivalent return is expected.” We still use this, of course, and in an even broader sense, calling that friend an Indian giver who is so uncivilized as to ask us to return a gift he has given. Imagine a scene. An Englishman comes into an Indian lodge, and his hosts, wishing to make their guest feel welcome, ask him to share a pipe of tobacco. Carved from a soft red stone, the pipe itself is a peace offering that has traditionally circulated among the local tribes, staying in each lodge for a time but always given away again sooner or later. And so the Indians, as is only polite among their people, give the pipe to their guest when he leaves. The Englishman is tickled pink. What a nice thing to send back to the British Museum! He takes it home and sets it on the mantelpiece. A time passes and the leaders of a neighboring tribe come to visit the colonist’s home. To his surprise he finds his guests have some expectation in regard to his pipe, and his translator finally explains to him that if he wishes to show his goodwill he should offer them a smoke and give them the pipe. In consternation the Englishman invents a phrase to describe these people with such a limited sense of private property. The opposite of “Indian giver” would be something like “white man keeper” (or maybe “capitalist”), that is, a person whose instinct is to remove property from circulation, to put it in a warehouse or museum (or, more to the point for capitalism, to lay it aside to be used for production).	The term "Indian giver" originated from a cultural misunderstanding between the Puritans and Native Americans regarding the concept of property. Native Americans had a tradition of circulating certain items, like a peace pipe, as a sign of goodwill, with the expectation that the item would be passed on to others. However, when an Englishman received such a gift, he viewed it as a permanent possession, leading to confusion when the Native Americans expected the item to be passed on. This cultural clash highlights different perspectives on property, with the "Indian giver" representing a culture that circulates property, and the "white man keeper" or "capitalist" representing a culture that removes property from circulation for private use or production.	Cultural Perspectives on Property: The Tale of the 'Indian Giver'
The Indian giver (or the original one, at any rate) understood a cardinal property of the gift: whatever we have been given is supposed to be given away again, not kept. Or, if it is kept, something of similar value should move on in its stead, the way a billiard ball may stop when it sends another scurrying across the felt, its momentum transferred. You may keep your Christmas present, but it ceases to be a gift in the true sense unless you have given something else away. As it is passed along, the gift may be given back to the original donor, but this is not essential. In fact, it is better if the gift is not returned but is given instead to some new, third party. The only essential is this: the gift must always move. There are other forms of property that stand still, that mark a boundary or resist momentum, but the gift keeps going.	Gifts are meant to be passed on, not kept. Even if retained, something of similar value should be given away. The key principle is that a gift must always be in motion, distinguishing it from static forms of property. This continuous circulation embodies the true essence of a gift.	The Perpetual Motion of Gifts
Tribal peoples usually distinguish between gifts and capital. Commonly they have a law that repeats the sensibility implicit in the idea of an Indian gift. “One man’s gift,” they say, “must not be another man’s capital.” Wendy James, a British social anthropologist, tells us that among the Uduk in northeast Africa, “any wealth transferred from one subclan to another, whether animals, grain or money, is in the nature of a gift, and should be consumed, and not invested for growth. If such transferred wealth is added to the subclan’s capital [cattle in this case] and kept for growth and investment, the subclan is regarded as being in an immoral relation of debt to the donors of the original gift.” If a pair of goats received as a gift from another subclan is kept to breed or to buy cattle, “there will be general complaint that the so-and-so’s are getting rich at someone else’s expense, behaving immorally by hoarding and investing gifts, and therefore being in a state of severe debt. It will be expected that they will soon suffer storm damage…”	Tribal societies often distinguish between gifts and capital. For instance, among the Uduk in northeast Africa, wealth transferred from one subclan to another is considered a gift and should be consumed, not invested for growth. If such a gift is used as capital, it's seen as an immoral debt, leading to societal disapproval and expectations of misfortune.	Gifts vs. Capital in Tribal Societies
The goats in this example move from one clan to another just as the stone pipe moved from person to person in my imaginary scene. And what happens then? If the object is a gift, it keeps moving, which in this case means that the man who received the goats throws a big party and everyone gets fed. The goats needn’t be given back, but they surely can’t be set aside to produce milk or more goats. And a new note has been added: the feeling that if a gift is not treated as such, if one form of property is converted into another, something horrible will happen. In folk tales the person who tries to hold on to a gift usually dies; in this anecdote the risk is “storm damage.” (What happens in fact to most tribal groups is worse than storm damage. Where someone manages to commercialize a tribe’s gift relationships the social fabric of the group is invariably destroyed.)	In tribal societies, gifts are expected to keep moving, symbolizing the continuous flow of relationships and goodwill. Misusing a gift, such as using it for personal gain or capital, is seen as a violation of this social contract. Folk tales often depict severe consequences for such actions.	The Consequences of Misusing Gifts in Tribal Societies
If we turn now to a folk tale, we will be able to see all of this from a different angle. Folk tales are like collective dreams; they are told in the kind of voice we hear at the edge of sleep, mingling the facts of our lives with their images in the psyche. The first tale I have chosen was collected from a Scottish woman in the middle of the nineteenth century.	Folk tales blend life facts with psychological imagery, reflecting societal norms. Studying a 19th-century Scottish tale can provide insights into societal dynamics of that era.	Folk Tales as Collective Dreams
The Girl and the Dead Man		
Once upon a time there was an old woman and she had a leash of daughters. One day the eldest daughter said to her mother, “It is time for me to go out into the world and seek my fortune.” “I shall bake a loaf of bread for you to carry with you,” said the mother. When the bread came from the oven the mother asked her daughter, “Would you rather have a small piece and my blessing or a large piece and my curse?” “I would rather have the large piece and your curse,” replied the daughter. Off she went down the road and when the night came wreathing around her she sat at the foot of a wall to eat her bread. A ground quail and her twelve puppies gathered near, and the little birds of the air. “Wilt thou give us a part of thy bread?” they asked. “I won’t, you ugly brutes,” she replied. “I haven’t enough for myself.” “My curse on thee,” said the quail, “and the curse of my twelve birds, and thy mother’s curse which is the worst of all.” The girl arose and went on her way, and the piece of bread had not been half enough. She had not traveled far before she saw a little house, and though it seemed a long way off she soon found herself before its door. She knocked and heard a voice cry out, “Who is there?” “A good maid seeking a master.” “We need that,” said the voice, and the door swung open. The girl’s task was to stay awake every night and watch over a dead man, the brother of the housewife, whose corpse was restless. As her reward she was to receive a peck of gold and a peck of silver. And while she stayed she was to have as many nuts as she broke, as many needles as she lost, as many thimbles as she pierced, as much thread as she used, as many candles as she burned, a bed of green silk over her and a bed of green silk under her, sleeping by day and watching by night. On the very first night, however, she fell asleep in her chair. The housewife came in, struck her with a magic club, killed her dead, and threw her out back on the pile of kitchen garbage. Soon thereafter the middle daughter said to her mother, “It is time for me to follow my sister and seek my fortune.” Her mother baked her a loaf of bread and she too chose the larger piece and her mother’s curse. And what had happened to her sister happened to her. Soon thereafter the youngest daughter said to her mother, “It is time for me to follow my sisters and seek my fortune.” “I had better bake you a loaf of bread,” said her mother, “and which would you rather have, a small piece and my blessing or a large piece and my curse?” “I would rather,” said the daughter, “have the smaller piece and your blessing.” And so she set off down the road and when the night came wreathing around her she sat at the foot of a wall to eat her bread. The ground quail and her twelve puppies and the little birds of the air gathered about. “Wilt thou give us some of that?” they asked. “I will, you pretty creatures, if you will keep me company.” She shared her bread, all of them ate their fill, and the birds clapped their wings about her Ⅎtil she was snug with the warmth. The next morning she saw a house a long way off … [here the task and the wages are repeated]. She sat up at night to watch the corpse, sewing to pass the time. About midnight the dead man sat up and screwed up a grin. “If you do not lie down properly I will give you one good leathering with a stick,” she cried. He lay down. After a while he rose up on one elbow and screwed up a grin; and a third time he sat and screwed up a grin. When he rose the third time she walloped him with the stick. The stick stuck to the dead man and her hand stuck to the stick and off they went! He dragged her through the woods, and when it was high for him it was low for her, and when it was low for him it was high for her. The nuts were knocking at their eyes and the wild plums beat at their ears until they both got through the wood. Then they returned home. The girl was given the peck of gold, the peck of silver, and a vessel of cordial. She found her two sisters and rubbed them with the cordial and brought them back to life. And they left me sitting here, and if they were well, ′tis well; if they were not, let them be.	An old woman's three daughters each decide to seek their fortune. The mother bakes each a loaf of bread, offering a small piece with her blessing or a large piece with her curse. The eldest two choose the larger piece and the curse, and both meet unfortunate ends while serving in a haunted house. The youngest daughter chooses the smaller piece and her mother's blessing. She shares her bread with animals, receives their blessings, and successfully completes the haunted house task. She revives her sisters with a magical cordial, demonstrating the power of generosity and blessings.	The Blessing and the Curse: A Folk Tale
There are at least four gifts in this story. The first, of course, is the bread, which the mother gives to her daughters as a going-away present. This becomes the second gift when the youngest daughter shares her bread with the birds. She keeps the gift in motion—the moral point of the tale. Several benefits, in addition to her survival, come to her as a result of treating the gift correctly. These are the fruits of the gift. First, she and the birds are relieved of their hunger; second, the birds befriend her; and third, she’s able to stay awake all night and accomplish her task. (As we shall see, these results are not accidental, they are typical fruits of the gift.)	In a folk tale, the mother's bread is the first gift, which becomes the second gift when the youngest daughter shares it with birds.  This act of keeping the gift in motion brings her benefits like satiating hunger, gaining bird allies, and successfully completing her task, demonstrating the positive outcomes of proper gift exchange.	The Cycle of Gifts
In the morning the third gift, the vessel of cordial, appears. “Cordial” used to mean a liqueur taken to stimulate the heart. In the original Gaelic of this tale the phrase is ballen íocshlaint, which translates more literally as “teat of ichor” or “teat of health” (“ichor” being the fluid that flows instead of blood in the veins of the gods). So what the girl is given is a vial of healing liquid, not unlike the “water of life,” which appears in folk tales from all over the world. It has power: with it she is able to revive her sisters.	The third gift in the folk tale is a vessel of cordial, a healing liquid similar to the "water of life" found in many folk tales. This powerful gift enables the girl to revive her sisters, demonstrating the transformative power of gifts.	The Healing Gift
This liquid is thrown in as a reward for the successful completion of her task. It’s a gift, mentioned nowhere in the wonderful litany of wages offered to each daughter. We will leave for later the question of where it comes from; for now, we are looking at what happens to the gift after it is given, and again we find that this girl is no dummy—she moves it right along, giving it to her sisters to bring them back to life. That is the fourth and final gift in the tale.	The tale concludes with the girl using a healing liquid, a gift she received, to revive her sisters, thus continuing the cycle of giving.	The Final Gift
This story also gives us a chance to see what happens if the gift is not allowed to move on. A gift that cannot move loses its gift properties. Traditional belief in Wales holds that when the fairies give bread to the poor, the loaves must be eaten on the day they are given or they will turn to toadstools. If we think of the gift as a constantly flowing river, we may say that the girl in the tale who treats it correctly does so by allowing herself to become a channel for its current. When someone tries to dam up the river, one of two things will happen: either it will stagnate or it will fill the person up until he bursts. In this folk tale it is not just the mother’s curse that gets the first two girls. The night birds give them a second chance, and one imagines the mother bird would not have repeated the curse had she met with generosity. But instead the girls try to dam the flow, thinking that what counts is ownership and size. The effect is clear: by keeping the gift they get no more. They are no longer channels for the stream and they no longer enjoy its fruits, one of which seems to be their own lives. Their mother’s bread has turned to toadstools inside them.	The story illustrates the concept that a gift that is not passed on loses its essence as a gift. When the girls in the tale try to hoard the gift, it stagnates and they lose its benefits, including their own lives. The gift must flow like a river, and those who try to dam it up suffer the consequences.	The Stagnation of Hoarded Gifts
Another way to describe the motion of the gift is to say that a gift must always be used up, consumed, eaten. The gift is property that perishes. It is no accident that the gifts in two of our stories so far have been food. Food is one of the most common images for the gift because it is so obviously consumed. Even when the gift is not food, when it is something we would think of as a durable good, it is often referred to as a thing to be eaten. Shell necklaces and armbands are the ritual gifts in the Trobriand Islands, and when they are passed from one group to the next, protocol demands that the man who gives them away toss them on the ground and say, “Here, some food we could not eat.” Or, again, a man in another tribe that Wendy James has studied says, in speaking of the money he was given at the marriage of his daughter, that he will pass it on rather than spend it on himself. Only, he puts it this way: “If I receive money for the children God has given me, I cannot eat it. I must give it to others.”	Gifts, symbolized often by food, are meant to be consumed or used up, not hoarded. Even durable goods are referred to as items to be 'eaten', emphasizing the transient nature of gifts. The act of giving away is a crucial aspect of the gift's life cycle, reinforcing its purpose and value.	The Consumable Nature of Gifts
Many of the most famous of the gift systems we know about center on food and treat durable goods as if they were food. The potlatch of the American Indians along the North Pacific coast was originally a “big feed.” At its simplest a pot-latch was a feast lasting several days given by a member of a tribe who wanted his rank in the group to be publicly recognized. Marcel Mauss translates the verb “potlatch” as “to nourish” or “to consume.” Used as a noun, a “potlatch” is a “feeder” or “place to be satiated.” Potlatches included durable goods, but the point of the festival was to have these perish as if they were food. Houses were burned; ceremonial objects were broken and thrown into the sea. One of the potlatch tribes, the Haida, called their feasting “killing wealth.”	The potlatch, a traditional feast among North Pacific coast tribes, symbolizes the transient nature of gifts. It involves not only the sharing of food but also the destruction of durable goods, emphasizing the concept of 'killing wealth'. This ritual highlights the idea that gifts, like food, are meant to be consumed or used up.	Potlatch: The Consumption of Wealth
To say that the gift is used up, consumed, and eaten sometimes means that it is truly destroyed as in these last examples, but more simply and accurately it means that the gift perishes for the person who gives it away. In gift exchange the transaction itself consumes the object. Now, it is true that something often comes back when a gift is given, but if this were made an explicit condition of the exchange, it wouldn’t be a gift. If the girl in our story had offered to sell the bread to the birds, the whole tone would have been different. But instead she sacrifices it: her mother’s gift is dead and gone when it leaves her hand. She no longer controls it, nor has she any contract about repayment. For her, the gift has perished. This, then, is how I use “consume” to speak of a gift—a gift is consumed when it moves from one hand to another with no assurance of anything in return. There is little difference, therefore, between its consumption and its movement. A market exchange has an equilibrium or stasis: you pay to balance the scale. But when you give a gift there is momentum, and the weight shifts from body to body.	A gift is consumed when it is given without the expectation of a return, signifying a shift in control and ownership. Unlike market exchanges that aim for equilibrium, gift-giving carries momentum, transferring value from one person to another. This process is not about balancing scales, but about the movement and transformation of the gift.	The Momentum of Gift-Giving
I must add one more word on what it is to consume, because the Western industrial world is famous for its “consumer goods” and they are not at all what I mean. Again, the difference is in the form of the exchange, a thing we can feel most concretely in the form of the goods themselves. I remember the time I went to my first rare-book fair and saw how the first editions of Thoreau and Whitman and Crane had been carefully packaged in heat-shrunk plastic with the price tags on the inside. Somehow the simple addition of air-tight plastic bags had transformed the books from vehicles of liveliness into commodities, like bread made with chemicals to keep it from perishing. In commodity exchange it’s as if the buyer and the seller were both in plastic bags; there’s none of the contact of a gift exchange. There is neither motion nor emotion because the whole point is to keep the balance, to make sure the exchange itself doesn’t consume anything or involve one person with another. Consumer goods are consumed by their owners, not by their exchange.	Unlike gifts, consumer goods are not consumed through exchange but by their owners. The exchange of consumer goods lacks the emotional connection and momentum inherent in gift-giving. The aim is to maintain balance, preventing the exchange from consuming anything or fostering personal involvement, which contrasts with the transformative nature of gifts.	The Distinction Between Gifts and Consumer Goods
The desire to consume is a kind of lust. We long to have the world flow through us like air or food. We are thirsty and hungry for something that can only be carried inside bodies. But consumer goods merely bait this lust, they do not satisfy it. The consumer of commodities is invited to a meal without passion, a consumption that leads to neither satiation nor fire. He is a stranger seduced into feeding on the drippings of someone else’s capital without benefit of its inner nourishment, and he is hungry at the end of the meal, depressed and weary as we all feel when lust has dragged us from the house and led us to nothing.	Consumerism is likened to an unsatisfied lust, where the consumption of commodities fails to satiate or ignite passion, leaving the consumer feeling empty and weary.	The Unfulfilled Desire of Consumerism
Gift exchange has many fruits, as we shall see, and to the degree that the fruits of the gift can satisfy our needs there will always be pressure for property to be treated as a gift. This pressure, in a sense, is what keeps the gift in motion. When the Uduk warn that a storm will ruin the crops if someone tries to stop the gift from moving, it is really their desire for the gift that will bring the storm. A restless hunger springs up when the gift is not being eaten. The brothers Grimm found a folk tale they called “The Ungrateful Son”:	When gifts are not allowed to move, a restless hunger arises, as illustrated in the Grimm Brothers' tale "The Ungrateful Son".	The Consequences of Stagnant Gifts
Once a man and his wife were sitting outside the front door with a roast chicken before them which they were going to eat between them. Then the man saw his old father coming along and quickly took the chicken and hid it, for he begrudged him any of it. The old man came, had a drink, and went away. Now the son was about to put the roast chicken back on the table, but when he reached for it, it had turned into a big toad that jumped in his face and stayed there and didn’t go away again. And if anybody tried to take it away, it would give them a poisonous look, as if about to jump in their faces, so that no one dared touch it. And the ungrateful son had to feed the toad every day, otherwise it would eat part of his face. And thus he went ceaselessly hither and yon about in the world.	In "The Ungrateful Son," a man hides a roast chicken, a gift, from his father, refusing to share it. As a result, the chicken transforms into a toad that attaches itself to his face, refusing to leave. The man is forced to feed the toad daily, or risk it eating his face. 	The Ungrateful Son
This toad is the hunger that appears when the gift stops moving, whenever one man’s gift becomes another man’s capital. To the degree that we desire the fruits of the gift, teeth appear when it is hidden away. When property is hoarded, thieves and beggars begin to be born to rich men’s wives. A story like this says that there is a force seeking to keep the gift in motion. Some property must perish—its preservation is beyond us. We have no choice. Or rather, our choice is whether to keep the gift moving or to be eaten with it. We choose between the toad’s dumb-lust and that other, more graceful perishing in which our hunger disappears as our gifts are consumed.	The story illustrates the importance of keeping gifts in motion. When a gift is hoarded or turned into capital, it loses its inherent value and becomes a burden. The choice is between keeping the gift moving, which brings satisfaction and fulfillment, or hoarding it, which leads to negative consequences.	The Consequences of Hoarding Gifts
 II. The Circle // The Gift is to the Giver, and Comes Back Most to Him 		
A bit of a mystery remains in the Scottish tale “The Girl and the Dead Man”: Where does the vessel of cordial come from? My guess is that it comes from the mother or, at least, from her spirit. The gift not only moves, it moves in a circle. The mother gives the bread and the girl gives it in turn to the birds whom I place in the realm of the mother, not only because it is a mother bird who addresses her, but also because of a verbal link (the mother has a “leash of daughters,” the mother bird has her “puppies”). The vessel of cordial is in the realm of the mother as well, for, remember, the phrase in Gaelic means “teat of ichor” or “teat of health.” The level changes, to be sure—it is a different sort of mother whose breasts hold the blood of the gods—but it is still in the maternal sphere. Structurally, then, the gift moves from mother to daughter to mother to daughter. In circling twice in this way the gift itself increases from bread to the water of life, from carnal food to spiritual food. At which point the circle expands as the girl gives the gift to her sisters to bring them back to life.	The story "The Girl and the Dead Man" illustrates the circular movement of gifts. The mother gives bread to her daughter, who in turn gives it to the birds. This act of generosity is rewarded with a vessel of cordial, a gift from the realm of the mother. The gift has transformed from physical sustenance to spiritual nourishment. The circle of giving expands when the girl uses the gift to revive her sisters, demonstrating that the value of a gift increases when it is kept in motion.	The Circular Journey of Gifts
The figure of the circle in which the gift moves can be seen more clearly in an example from ethnography. Gift institutions are universal among tribal peoples; the few we know the most about are those which Western ethnographers studied around the turn of the century. One of these is the Kula, the ceremonial exchange of the Massim peoples who occupy the South Sea islands near the eastern tip of New Guinea. Bronislaw Malinowski spent several years living on these islands during the First World War, staying primarily in the Trobriands, the northwesternmost group. In his subsequent book, Argonauts of the Western Pacific, Malinowski describes how, after he had returned to England, a visit to Edinburgh Castle to see the Scottish crown jewels reminded him of the Kula:	The Kula is a tradition among the Massim people near New Guinea, involving a circular exchange of valuable items. This practice emphasizes the social and cultural importance of giving and receiving gifts.	The Kula: A Circle of Gift Exchange
The keeper told many stories of how [the jewels] were worn by this or that king or queen on such and such an occasion, of how some of them had been taken over to London, to the great and just indignation of the whole Scottish nation, how they were restored, and how now everyone can be pleased, since they are safe under lock and key, and no one can touch them. As I was looking at them and thinking how ugly, useless, ungainly, even tawdry they were, I had the feeling that something similar had been told to me of late, and that I had seen many other objects of this sort, which made a similar impression on me. And then there arose before me the vision of a native village on coral soil, and a small, rickety platform temporarily erected under a pandanus thatch, surrounded by a number of brown, naked men, and one of them showing me long, thin red strings, and big, white, worn-out objects, clumsy to sight and greasy to touch. With reverence he also would name them, and tell their history, and by whom and when they were worn, and how they changed hands, and how their temporary possession was a great sign of the importance and glory of the village.	The Kula tradition among the Massim people, involving the ceremonial exchange of valuable items, is compared to the reverence and history associated with the Scottish crown jewels. Despite their physical differences, both sets of objects hold significant cultural and social value within their respective communities.	The Kula and the Crown Jewels: A Comparison
Two ceremonial gifts lie at the heart of the Kula exchange: armshells and necklaces. “Armshells are obtained by breaking off the top and the narrow end of a big, cone-shaped shell, and then polishing up the remaining ring,” writes Malinowski. Necklaces are made with small flat disks of a red shell strung into long chains. Both armshells and necklaces circulate throughout the islands, passing from household to household. The presence of one of these gifts in a man’s house enables him “to draw a great deal of renown, to exhibit the article, to tell how he obtained it, and to plan to whom he is going to give it. And all this forms one of the favorite subjects of tribal conversation and gossip …”	The Kula exchange is a ceremonial gifting tradition among the Massim people, involving the circulation of shell-made armshells and necklaces. These items bring prestige to their temporary holders and stimulate social interaction within the community.	The Kula Exchange: Armshells and Necklaces
Malinowski calls the Kula articles “ceremonial gifts” because their social use far exceeds their practical use. A friend of mine tells me that his group of friends in college continually passed around a deflated basketball. The joke was to get it mysteriously deposited in someone else’s room. The clear uselessness of such objects seems to make it easier for them to become vehicles for the spirit of a group. Another man tells me that when he was young his parents and their best friends passed back and forth, again as a joke, a huge open-ended wrench that had apparently been custom-cast to repair a steam shovel. The two families had found it one day on a picnic, and for years thereafter it showed up first in one house, then in the other, under the Christmas tree or in the umbrella stand. If you have not yourself been a part of such an exchange, you will easily turn up a story like these by asking around, for such spontaneous exchanges of “useless” gifts are fairly common, though hardly ever developed to the depth and elegance that Malinowski found among the Massim.	Useless objects, like a deflated basketball or a large wrench, often become symbolic gifts within a group, circulating among its members. These items, despite their lack of practical use, carry a social significance and foster a sense of community and shared history. This phenomenon is seen in various cultures, including the Massim people's Kula exchange.	The Spirit of Useless Gifts
The Kula gifts, the armshells and necklaces, move continually around a wide ring of islands in the Massim archipelago. Each travels in a circle; the red shell necklaces (considered to be “male” and worn by women) move clockwise and the armshells (“female” and worn by men) move counterclockwise. A person who participates in the Kula has gift partners in neighboring tribes. If we imagine him facing the center of the circle with partners on his left and right, he will always be receiving armshells from his partner to the left and giving them to the man on his right. The necklaces flow the other way. Of course, these objects are not actually passed hand to hand; they are carried by canoe from island to island in journeys that require great preparation and cover hundreds of miles.	In the Kula exchange, armshells and necklaces move in opposite directions around the Massim archipelago. Armshells, considered "female," move counterclockwise, while necklaces, deemed "male," move clockwise. This circular movement of gifts, requiring significant preparation and travel, emphasizes the importance of maintaining the flow of gifts in the community.	The Direction of Gifts in Kula Exchange
The two Kula gifts are exchanged for each other. If a man brings me a necklace, I will give him in return some armshells of equivalent value. I may do this right away, or I may wait as long as a year (though if I wait that long I will give him a few smaller gifts in the interim to show my good faith). As a rule it takes between two and ten years for each article in the Kula to make a full round of the islands.	In the Kula exchange, armshells and necklaces are traded for each other, maintaining a balance of value. The exchange may happen immediately or be delayed up to a year, with smaller interim gifts given as a sign of goodwill. Typically, it takes between two to ten years for each Kula item to complete a full circuit of the islands.	The Reciprocity of Kula Exchange
Because these gifts are exchanged for each other, the Kula seems to break the rule against equilibrium that I set out in the first section. But let us look more closely. We should first note that the Kula articles are kept in motion. Each gift stays with a man for a while, but if he keeps it too long he will begin to have a reputation for being “slow” and “hard” in the Kula. The gifts “never stop,” writes Malinowski. “It seems almost incredible at first …, but it is the fact, nevertheless, that no one ever keeps any of the Kula valuables for any length of time … ‘Ownership,’ therefore, in Kula, is quite a special economic relation. A man who is in the Kula never keeps any article for longer than, say, a year or two.” When Malinowski expands on this point, he finds he must abandon his analogy to the crown jewels. The Trobriand Islanders know what it is to own property, but their sense of possession is wholly different from that of Europeans. The “social code … lays down that to possess is to be great, and that wealth is the indispensable appanage of social rank and attribute of personal virtue. But the important point is that with them to possess is to give— and here the natives differ from us notably. A man who owns a thing is naturally expected to share it, to distribute it, to be its trustee and dispenser.”	In the Kula exchange, the concept of ownership is distinct from Western perspectives. While the Massim people value possession as a sign of social rank and personal virtue, they also believe that to possess is to give. Thus, a person who receives a gift in the Kula exchange is expected to pass it on within a year or two, acting as a trustee and dispenser of the item. This practice underscores the importance of generosity and sharing in their culture.	A Cycle of Generosity
The motion of the Kula gifts does not in itself ensure that there will be no equilibrium, for, as we have seen, they move but they are also exchanged. Two ethics, however, govern this exchange and both of them ensure that, while there may be a macroscopic equilibrium, at the level of each man there will be the sense of imbalance, of shifting weight, that always marks a gift exchange. The first of these ethics prohibits discussion: “the Kula,” writes Malinowski, “consists in the bestowing of a ceremonial gift, which has to be repaid by an equivalent counter-gift after a lapse of time … But [and this is the point] it can never be exchanged from hand to hand, with the equivalence between the two objects discussed, bargained about and computed.” A man may wonder what will come in return for his gift, but he is not supposed to bring it up. Gift exchange is not a form of barter. “The decorum of the Kula transaction is strictly kept, and highly valued. The natives distinguish it from barter, which they practice extensively [and] of which they have a clear idea … Often, when criticising an incorrect, too hasty, or indecorous procedure of Kula, they will say: ′He conducts his Kula as if it were [barter].′” Partners in barter talk and talk until they strike a balance, but the gift is given in silence.	In the Kula exchange, the act of giving and receiving is governed by a code of ethics that prohibits discussion or bargaining over the value of the gifts. This practice distinguishes the Kula exchange from barter, which involves negotiation until a balance is struck. In Kula, gifts are given in silence, and the expectation of a counter-gift is unspoken. This decorum is highly valued in the Massim culture, and any deviation from it is considered improper.	The Silent Exchange in Kula
A second important ethic, Malinowski tells us, “is that the equivalence of the counter-gift is left to the giver, and it cannot be enforced by any kind of coercion.” If a man gives a second-rate necklace in return for a fine set of armshells, people may talk, but there is nothing anyone can do about it. When we barter we make deals, and if someone defaults we go after him, but the gift must be a gift. It is as if you give a part of your substance to your gift partner and then wait in silence until he gives you a part of his. You put your self in his hands. These rules—and they are typical of gift institutions— preserve the sense of motion despite the exchange involved. There is trade, but the objects traded are not commodities.	In the Kula exchange, the value of the counter-gift is determined by the giver, and cannot be enforced or coerced. This practice distinguishes it from barter, where deals are made and enforced. In Kula, a person gives a part of their substance and waits for the other to reciprocate in their own time and manner. This maintains the sense of motion and the spirit of gift-giving, despite the element of exchange.	The Ethics of Kula Exchange
We commonly think of gifts as being exchanged between two people and of gratitude as being directed back to the actual donor. “Reciprocity,” the standard social science term for returning a gift, has this sense of going to and fro between people (the roots are re and pro, back and forth, like a reciprocating engine). The gift in the Scottish tale is given reciprocally, going back and forth between the mother and her daughter (until the very end).	Gifts traditionally involve a reciprocal exchange between two individuals. This reciprocity is a back-and-forth process, as exemplified in the Scottish tale where the gift moves between the mother and daughter.	Reciprocity
Reciprocal giving is a form of gift exchange, but it is the simplest. The gift moves in a circle, and two people do not make much of a circle. Two points establish a line, but a circle lies in a plane and needs at least three points. This is why, as we shall see, most of the stories of gift exchange have a minimum of three people. I have introduced the Kula circuit here because it is such a fine example. For the Kula gifts to move, each man must have at least two gift partners. In this case the circle is larger than that, of course, but three is its lower limit.	Reciprocal giving, while a form of gift exchange, is the most basic form. True gift exchange moves in a circle, requiring at least three participants to form a cycle. The Kula circuit exemplifies this.	The Circle of Giving Beyond Reciprocity
Circular giving differs from reciprocal giving in several ways. First, when the gift moves in a circle no one ever receives it from the same person he gives it to. I continually give armshells to my partner to the west, but unlike a two-person give-and-take, he never gives me armshells in return. The whole mood is different. The circle is the structural equivalent of the prohibition on discussion. When I give to someone from whom I do not receive (and yet I do receive elsewhere), it is as if the gift goes around a corner before it comes back. I have to give blindly. And I will feel a sort of blind gratitude as well. The smaller the circle is—and particularly if it involves just two people—the more a man can keep his eye on things and the more likely it is that he will start to think like a salesman. But so long as the gift passes out of sight it cannot be manipulated by one man or one pair of gift partners. When the gift moves in a circle its motion is beyond the control of the personal ego, and so each bearer must be a part of the group and each donation is an act of social faith.	Circular giving, where the gift moves among a group, differs from reciprocal giving in that no one receives a gift from the same person they give to. This creates a sense of blind giving and gratitude, as the gift goes out of sight before it comes back. This system is less susceptible to manipulation and fosters a sense of community and social faith among participants.	Circular Giving: A Social Act of Faith
What size is the circle? In addressing this question, I have come to think of the circle, the container in which the gift moves, as its “body” or “ego.” Psychologists sometimes speak of the ego as a complex like any other: the Mother, the Father, the Me—all of these are important places in the field of the psyche where images and energy cluster as we grow, like stars in a constellation. The ego complex takes on shape and size as the Me—that part of the psyche which takes everything personally—retains our private history, that is, how others have treated us, how we look and feel, and so on.	In circular giving, the size of the circle can be seen as its collective identity. This concept mirrors psychological theories of the ego, where it represents personal identity and history.	Collective Identity in Circular Giving
I find it useful to think of the ego complex as a thing that keeps expanding, not as something to be overcome or done away with. An ego has formed and hardened by the time most of us reach adolescence, but it is small, an ego-of-one. Then, if we fall in love, for example, the constellation of identity expands and the ego-of-one becomes an ego-of-two. The young lover, often to his own amazement, finds himself saying “we” instead of “me.” Each of us identifies with a wider and wider community as we mature, coming eventually to think and act with a group-ego (or, in most of these gift stories, a tribal ego), which speaks with the “we” of kings and wise old people. Of course the larger it becomes, the less it feels like what we usually mean by ego. Not entirely, though: whether an adolescent is thinking of himself or a nation of itself, it still feels like egotism to anyone who is not included. There is still a boundary.	The ego, often seen as an individual concept, can expand beyond the self. This happens when we form close relationships, such as falling in love, where our sense of identity includes another person. This expansion can extend to larger groups, creating a collective identity or 'group-ego'. This concept is reflected in the circular giving of gifts, where the identity of the group is intertwined with the act of giving and receiving.	From Individual to Collective Identity
If the ego widens still further, however, it really does change its nature and become something we would no longer call ego. There is a consciousness in which we act as part of things larger even than the race. When I picture this, I always think of the end of “Song of Myself” where Whitman dissolves into the air: I effuse my flesh in eddies, and drift it in lacy jags. I bequeath myself to the dirt to grow from the grass I love, If you want me again look for me under your boot-soles. Now the part that says “me” is scattered. There is no boundary to be outside of, unless the universe itself is bounded.	When the ego expands beyond the individual and the collective, it transforms into a consciousness that is part of something larger than humanity itself. This is beautifully illustrated in Whitman's "Song of Myself", where he dissolves into the natural world, becoming one with it. 	The Boundless Ego
In all of this we could substitute “body” for “ego.” Aborigines commonly refer to their own clan as “my body,” just as our marriage ceremony speaks of becoming “one flesh.” Again, the body can be enlarged beyond the private skin, and in its final expansion there is no body at all. When we are in the spirit of the gift we love to feel the body open outward. The ego’s firmness has its virtues, but at some point we seek the slow dilation, to use another term of Whitman’s, in which the ego enjoys a widening give-and-take with the world and is finally abandoned in ripeness.	The concept of the 'ego' can be expanded beyond the individual, encompassing a clan or a collective. This expansion can lead to a sense of unity and connection with the world around us. In the spirit of the gift, this expansion is a joyful process, leading to a sense of openness and connection with the wider world.	Expansion of Self: From Ego to Unity
The gift can circulate at every level of the ego. In the ego-of-one we speak of self-gratification, and whether it’s forced or chosen, a virtue or a vice, the mark of self-gratification is its isolation. Reciprocal giving, the ego-of-two, is a little more social. We think mostly of lovers. Each of these circles is exhilarating as it expands, and the little gifts that pass between lovers touch us because each is stepping into a larger circuit. But again, if the exchange goes on and on to the exclusion of others, it soon goes stale. D. H. Lawrence spoke of the égoisme à deux of so many married couples, people who get just so far in the expansion of the self and then close down for a lifetime, opening up for neither children, nor the group, nor the gods. A folk tale from Kashmir tells of two Brahmin women who tried to dispense with their almsgiving duties by simply giving alms back and forth to each other. They didn’t quite have the spirit of the thing. When they died, they returned to earth as two wells so poisoned that no one could take water from them. No one else can drink from the ego-of-two. It has its moment in our maturation, but it is an infant form of the gift circle.	Gifts can circulate at every level of the ego, from self-gratification to reciprocal giving between two individuals, often seen in romantic relationships. However, if this exchange becomes exclusive and closed off from others, it can become stagnant. The expansion of the self through giving is a dynamic process that ideally extends beyond the individual or the couple, reaching out to the wider community and even to the divine.	The Dynamics of Giving: From Self to Community
In the Kula we have already seen a fine example of the larger circle. The Maori, the native tribes of New Zealand, provide another, which is similar in some ways to the Kula but offers new detail and a hint of how gift exchange will feel if the circle expands beyond the body of the tribe. The Maori have a word, hau, which translates as “spirit,” particularly the spirit of the gift and the spirit of the forest which gives food. In these tribes, when hunters return from the forest with birds they have killed, they give a portion of the kill to the priests, who, in turn, cook the birds at a sacred fire. The priests eat a few of them and then prepare a sort of talisman, the mauri, which is the physical embodiment of the forest hau. This mauri is a gift the priests give back to the forest, where, as a Maori sage once explained to an Englishman, it “causes the birds to be abundant…, that they may be slain and taken by man.”	The Maori tribes in New Zealand participate in a gift exchange that involves nature. They believe in 'hau', the spirit of the gift and the forest. Hunters give a portion of their game to priests, who create a talisman, the mauri, which is returned to the forest to ensure future abundance.	The Maori Gift Exchange
There are three gifts in this hunting ritual: the forest gives to the hunters, the hunters to the priests, and the priests to the forest. At the end, the gift moves from the third party back to the first. The ceremony that the priests perform is called whangai hau, which means “nourishing hau,” feeding the spirit. To give such a name to the priests’ activity says that the addition of the third party keeps the spirit of the gift alive. Put conversely, without the priests there is a danger that the motion of the gift will be lost. It seems to be too much to ask of the hunters to both kill the game and return a gift to the forest. As we said in speaking of the Kula, gift exchange is more likely to turn into barter when it falls into the ego-of-two. With a simple give-and-take, the hunters may begin to think of the forest as a place to turn a profit. But with the priests involved, the gift must leave the hunters’ sight before it returns to the woods. The priests take on or incarnate the position of the third thing to avoid the binary relation of the hunters and forest which by itself would not be abundant. The priests, by their presence alone, feed the spirit.	In the Maori hunting ritual, three gifts are exchanged: from the forest to the hunters, from the hunters to the priests, and from the priests back to the forest. This circular exchange, facilitated by the priests, nourishes the 'hau' or spirit of the gift, keeping it alive and maintaining the abundance of the forest. The priests' role prevents the exchange from becoming a mere transaction, preserving the spirit of the gift.	The Role of Priests in Maori Gift Exchange
Every gift calls for a return gift, and so, by placing the gift back in the forest, the priests treat the birds as a gift of nature. We now understand this to be ecological. Ecology as a science began at the end of the nineteenth century, an offshoot of the rising interest in evolution. Originally the study of how animals survive in their environments, one of ecology’s first lessons was that, beneath all the change in nature, there are steady states characterized by cycles. Every participant in the cycle literally lives off the others with only the ultimate energy source, the sun, being transcendent. Widening the study of ecology to include man means to look at ourselves as a part of nature again, not its lord. When we see that we are actors in natural cycles, we understand that what nature gives to us is influenced by what we give to nature. So the circle is a sign of an ecological insight as much as of gift exchange. We come to feel ourselves as one part of a large self-regulating system. The return gift, the “nourishing hau,” is literally feedback, as they say in cybernetics. Without it, that is to say, with the exercise of any greed or arrogance of will, the cycle is broken. We all know that it isn’t “really” the mauri placed in the forest that “causes” the birds to be abundant, and yet now we see that on a different level it is: the circle of gifts enters the cycles of nature and, in so doing, manages not to interrupt them and not to put man on the outside. The forest’s abundance is in fact a consequence of man’s treating its wealth as a gift.	In the Maori tradition, every gift necessitates a return gift, reflecting an ecological understanding of nature's cycles. By returning a gift to the forest, the priests acknowledge that humanity is part of nature, not its master. This cycle of giving and receiving aligns with natural cycles, reinforcing the idea that nature's abundance is a gift that requires respect and reciprocity. This practice of gift exchange embodies an ecological wisdom, recognizing that human actions impact nature's bounty.	Ecological Wisdom in Maori Gift Exchange
The Maori hunting ritual enlarges the circle within which the gift moves in two ways. First, it includes nature. Second and more important, it includes the gods. The priests act out a gift relationship with the deities, giving thanks and sacrificing gifts to them in return for what they give the tribe. A story from the Old Testament will show us the same thing in a tradition with which we are more familiar. The structure is identical.	The Maori hunting ritual involves a cycle of gifts that includes nature and the gods, reflecting a tradition of divine reciprocity.	Divine Reciprocity in Maori Tradition
In the Pentateuch the first fruits always belong to the Lord. In Exodus the Lord tells Moses: “Consecrate to me all the first-born; whatever is the first to open the womb among the people of Israel, both of man and of beast, is mine.” The Lord gives the tribe its wealth, and the germ of that wealth is then given back to the Lord. Fertility is a gift from God, and in order for it to continue, its first fruits are returned to him as a return gift. In pagan times this had apparently included sacrificing the firstborn son, but the Israelites had early been allowed to substitute an animal for the child, as in the story of Abraham and Isaac. Likewise a lamb was substituted for the firstborn of any unclean animal. The Lord says to Moses: All that opens the womb is mine, all your male cattle, the firstlings of cow and sheep. The firstling of an ass you shall redeem with a lamb, or if you will not redeem it you shall break its neck. All the firstborn of your sons you shall redeem.	The Pentateuch dictates that the first fruits belong to the Lord, symbolizing that fertility is a divine gift. In return, the first fruits are given back to the Lord. This used to include sacrificing the firstborn son, but substitutions were allowed, such as a lamb for a child or for the firstborn of an unclean animal.	Divine Reciprocity in the Pentateuch
Elsewhere the Lord explains to Aaron what is to be done with the firstborn. Aaron and his sons are responsible for the priesthood, and they minister at the altar. The lambs, calves, and kids are to be sacrificed: “You shall sprinkle their blood upon the altar, and shall burn their fat as an offering by fire, a pleasing odor to the Lord; but their flesh shall be yours …” As in the Maori story, the priests eat a portion of the gift. But its essence is burned and returned to the Lord in smoke.	In biblical tradition, firstborn animals are sacrificed to the Lord. Their blood is used in rituals, their fat is burned as an offering, and their flesh is consumed by priests. This practice signifies the return of God's gift back to Him.	Biblical Sacrifice: Returning God's Gift
This gift cycle has three stations and more—the flocks, the tribe, the priests, and the Lord. The inclusion of the Lord in the circle—and this is the point I began to make above— changes the ego in which the gift moves in a way unlike any other addition. It is enlarged beyond the tribal ego and beyond nature. Now, as I said when I first introduced the image, we would no longer call it an ego at all. The gift leaves all boundary and circles into mystery.	In this gift cycle, the inclusion of the Lord expands the circle beyond the tribal ego and nature, transcending boundaries and entering the realm of the divine and the mysterious.	The Divine Circle: Beyond Ego and Nature
The passage into mystery always refreshes. If, when we work, we can look once a day upon the face of mystery, then our labor satisfies. We are lightened when our gifts rise from pools we cannot fathom. Then we know they are not a solitary egotism and they are inexhaustible. Anything contained within a boundary must contain as well its own exhaustion. The most perfectly balanced gyroscope slowly winds down. But when the gift passes out of sight and then returns, we are enlivened. Material goods pull us down into their bones unless their fat is singed occasionally. It is when the world flames a bit in our peripheral vision that it brings us jubilation and not depression. We stand before a bonfire or even a burning house and feel the odd release it brings, as if the trees could give the sun return for what enters them through the leaf. When no property can move, then even Moses’s Pharaoh is plagued with hungry toads. A sword appears to seek the firstborn son of that man who cannot be moved to move the gift. But Pharaoh himself was dead long before his firstborn was taken, for we are only alive to the degree that we can let ourselves be moved. And when the gift circles into mystery the liveliness stays, for it is “a pleasing odor to the Lord” when the first fruits are effused in eddies and drifted in lacy jags above the flame.	The cycle of giving and receiving gifts, especially when it extends beyond the tangible and into the realm of the divine, brings a sense of renewal and vitality. Gifts that are freely circulated invigorate rather than deplete us, contrasting with the stagnation and decay that comes from hoarding or withholding. Giving without the expectation of immediate return is seen as a life-affirming and spiritually enriching practice.	Renewal and Vitality in the Cycle of Giving
I described the motion of the gift earlier in this chapter by saying that gifts are always used, consumed, or eaten. Now that we have seen the figure of the circle we can understand what seems at first to be a paradox of gift exchange: when the gift is used, it is not used up. Quite the opposite, in fact: the gift that is not used will be lost, while the one that is passed along remains abundant. In the Scottish tale the girls who hoard their bread are fed only while they eat. The meal finishes in hunger though they took the larger piece. The girl who shares her bread is satisfied. What is given away feeds again and again, while what is kept feeds only once and leaves us hungry.	Gifts that are shared continue to provide value, while hoarded gifts lose their worth. This is demonstrated in a Scottish tale where sharing leads to continuous satisfaction, while keeping leads to hunger.	Abundance in Sharing
The tale is a parable, but in the Kula ring we saw the same constancy as a social fact. The necklaces and armshells are not diminished by their use, but satisfy faithfully. Only when a foreigner steps in to buy some for his collection are they “used up” by a transaction. And the Maori hunting tale showed us that not just food in parables but food in nature remains abundant when it is treated as gift, when we participate in the moving circle and do not stand aside as hunter or exploiter. Gifts are a class of property whose value lies only in their use and which literally cease to exist as gifts if they are not constantly consumed. When gifts are sold, they change their nature as much as water changes when it freezes, and no rationalist telling of the constant elemental structure can replace the feeling that is lost.	Gifts maintain their value through their use and circulation, as seen in the Kula ring and the Maori hunting tale. When treated as commodities, gifts lose their inherent nature and value, much like water changing form when it freezes.	The Vitality of Circulating Gifts
In E. M. Forster’s novel A Passage to India, Dr. Aziz, the Muslim, and Fielding, the Englishman, have a brief dialogue, a typical debate between gift and commodity. Fielding says: “Your emotions never seem in proportion to their objects, Aziz.” “Is emotion a sack of potatoes, so much to the pound, to be measured out? Am I a machine? I shall be told I can use up my emotions by using them, next.” “I should have thought you would. It sounds common sense. You can’t eat your cake and have it, even in the world of the spirit.” “If you are right, there is no point in any friendship …, and we had better all leap over this parapet and kill ourselves.”	In E.M. Forster's novel, a conversation between Dr. Aziz and Fielding explores the difference between treating emotions like commodities or gifts. Fielding suggests emotions can be used up, while Aziz argues that if this were true, friendship would be pointless.	Emotions in Relationships
In the world of gift, as in the Scottish tale, you not only can have your cake and eat it too, you can’t have your cake unless you eat it. Gift exchange and erotic life are connected in this regard. The gift is an emanation of Eros, and therefore to speak of gifts that survive their use is to describe a natural fact: libido is not lost when it is given away. Eros never wastes his lovers. When we give ourselves in the spirit of that god, he does not leave off his attentions; it is only when we fall to calculation that he remains hidden and no body will satisfy. Satisfaction derives not merely from being filled but from being filled with a current that will not cease. With the gift, as in love, our satisfaction sets us at ease because we know that somehow its use at once assures its plenty.	Gift exchange, like love, provides satisfaction through continuous circulation, not mere possession. This mirrors the nature of Eros, the god of love, ensuring an enduring sense of abundance and satisfaction.	Eros and the Endless Gift
Scarcity and abundance have as much to do with the form of exchange as with how much material wealth is at hand. Scarcity appears when wealth cannot flow. Elsewhere in A Passage to India, Dr. Aziz says, “If money goes, money comes. If money stays, death comes. Did you ever hear that useful Urdu proverb?” And Fielding replies, “My proverbs are: A penny saved is a penny earned; A stitch in time saves nine; Look before you leap; and the British Empire rests on them.” He’s right. An empire needs its clerks with their ledgers and their clocks saving pennies in time. The problem is that wealth ceases to move freely when all things are counted and priced. It may accumulate in great heaps, but fewer and fewer people can afford to enjoy it. After the war in Bangladesh, thousands of tons of donated rice rotted in warehouses because the market was the only known mode of distribution, and the poor, naturally, couldn’t afford to buy. Marshall Sahlins begins a comment on modern scarcity with the paradoxical contention that hunters and gatherers “have affluent economies, their absolute poverty notwithstanding.” He writes:	The flow of wealth, not its quantity, determines abundance or scarcity. When wealth is hoarded or restricted, scarcity arises, even amidst plenty. This is evident in societies where wealth is accumulated but not freely distributed, leading to paradoxical situations of poverty amidst plenty.	Flow of Wealth
Modern capitalist societies, however richly endowed, dedicate themselves to the proposition of scarcity. [Both Paul Samuelson and Milton Friedman begin their economies with “The Law of Scarcity”; it’s all over by the end of Chapter One.] Inadequacy of economic means is the first principle of the world’s wealthiest peoples. The apparent material status of the economy seems to be no clue to its accomplishments; something has to be said for the mode of economic organization. The market-industrial system institutes scarcity, in a manner completely unparalleled and to a degree nowhere else approximated. Where production and distribution are arranged through the behavior of prices, and all livelihoods depend on getting and spending, insufficiency of material means becomes the explicit, calculable starting point of all economic activity.	Modern capitalist societies, despite their wealth, operate on the principle of scarcity. The market-industrial system inherently creates scarcity, as livelihoods depend on the fluctuation of prices and the cycle of earning and spending. This system makes material insufficiency the basis of all economic activity.	Capitalism and Scarcity
Given material abundance, scarcity must be a function of boundaries. If there is plenty of air in the world but something blocks its passage to the lungs, the lungs do well to complain of scarcity. The assumptions of market exchange may not necessarily lead to the emergence of boundaries, but they do in practice. When trade is “clean” and leaves people unconnected, when the merchant is free to sell when and where he will, when the market moves mostly for profit and the dominant myth is not “to possess is to give” but “the fittest survive,” then wealth will lose its motion and gather in isolated pools. Under the assumptions of exchange trade, property is plagued by entropy and wealth can become scarce even as it increases.	Scarcity in a world of material abundance is a result of boundaries that block the flow of resources. Market exchange often leads to such boundaries, as it prioritizes profit and survival of the fittest over the principle of giving. This can cause wealth to stagnate and accumulate in isolated pools, creating scarcity despite an overall increase in wealth.	Market Boundaries and Scarcity
A commodity is truly “used up” when it is sold because nothing about the exchange assures its return. The visiting sea captain may pay handsomely for a Kula necklace, but because the sale removes it from the circle, it wastes it, no matter the price. Gifts that remain gifts can support an affluence of satisfaction, even without numerical abundance. The mythology of the rich in the overproducing nations that the poor are in on some secret about satisfaction—black “soul,” gypsy duende, the noble savage, the simple farmer, the virile game keeper—obscures the harshness of modern capitalist poverty, but it does have a basis, for people who live in voluntary poverty or who are not capital-intensive do have more ready access to erotic forms of exchange that are neither exhausting nor exhaustible and whose use assures their plenty.	Commodities are depleted when sold, as the exchange doesn't guarantee their return. This contrasts with gifts, which can provide satisfaction even without abundance. The myth that the poor possess a secret to satisfaction obscures the reality of poverty, but it's true that those living in voluntary poverty or without capital-intensive lifestyles have more access to non-exhausting, plentiful forms of exchange.	Commodities, Gifts, and the Myth of Satisfaction
If the commodity moves to turn a profit, where does the gift move? The gift moves toward the empty place. As it turns in its circle it turns toward him who has been empty-handed the longest, and if someone appears elsewhere whose need is greater it leaves its old channel and moves toward him. Our generosity may leave us empty, but our emptiness then pulls gently at the whole until the thing in motion returns to replenish us. Social nature abhors a vacuum. Counsels Meister Eckhart, the mystic: “Let us borrow empty vessels.” The gift finds that man attractive who stands with an empty bowl he does not own.	Gifts gravitate towards those in need. When generosity leaves us empty, our emptiness attracts the gift back to us, replenishing us. The most attractive person to a gift is one who stands with an empty bowl they do not own.	The Movement of Gifts and the Attraction of Emptiness
The begging bowl of the Buddha, Thomas Merton has said, “represents the ultimate theological root of the belief, not just in a right to beg, but in openness to the gifts of all beings as an expression of the interdependence of all beings … The whole idea of compassion, which is central to Mahayana Buddhism, is based on an awareness of the interdependence of all living beings … Thus when the monk begs from the layman and receives a gift from the layman, it is not as a selfish person getting something from somebody else. He is simply opening himself to this interdependence …” The wandering mendicant takes it as his task to carry what is empty from door to door. There is no profit; he merely stays alive if the gift moves toward him. He makes its spirit visible to us. His well-being, then, is a sign of its well-being, as his starvation would be a sign of its withdrawal. Our English word “beggar” comes from the Beghards, a brotherhood of mendicant friars that grew up in the thirteenth century in Flanders. There are still some places in the East where wandering mendicants live from the begging bowl; in Europe they died out at the close of the Middle Ages.	The begging bowl of a mendicant monk symbolizes openness to the gifts of all beings, reflecting the interdependence of all living beings. The monk's survival depends on the movement of the gift towards him, making the spirit of the gift visible. His well-being is a sign of the gift's well-being.	The Begging Bowl and Interdependence
As the bearer of the empty place, the religious mendicant has an active duty beyond his supplication. He is the vehicle of that fluidity which is abundance. The wealth of the group touches his bowl at all sides, as if it were the center of a wheel where the spokes meet. The gift gathers there, and the mendicant gives it away again when he meets someone who is empty. In European folk tales the beggar often turns out to be Wotan, the true “owner” of the land, who asks for charity though it is his own wealth he moves within, and who then responds to neediness by filling it with gifts. He is godfather to the poor.	The religious mendicant, or beggar, is not just a recipient of gifts but also a distributor. As the center of the gift exchange wheel, he collects the wealth of the group and redistributes it to those in need. In European folk tales, this figure is often a disguised deity, symbolizing the cyclical nature of giving and receiving.	The Mendicant as Distributor of Wealth
Folk tales commonly open with a beggar motif. In a tale from Bengal, a king has two queens, both of whom are childless. A fakir, a wandering mendicant, comes to the palace gate to ask for alms. One of the queens walks down to give him a handful of rice. When he finds that she is childless, however, he says that he cannot accept the rice but has a gift for her instead, a potion that will remove her barrenness. If she drinks his nostrum with the juice of the pomegranate flower, he tells her, in due time she will bear a son whom she should then call the Pomegranate Boy. All this comes to pass and the tale proceeds.	In a Bengali folk tale, a childless queen gives alms to a wandering mendicant. Instead of accepting her gift, the mendicant gives her a potion to cure her barrenness. She follows his instructions, gives birth to a son, and the story continues.	The Mendicant's Gift in a Bengali Tale
Such stories declare that the gift does move from plenty to emptiness. It seeks the barren, the arid, the stuck, and the poor. The Lord says, “All that opens the womb is mine,” for it is He who filled the empty womb, having earlier stood as a beggar by the sacrificial fire or at the gates of the palace.	Stories often depict gifts moving towards emptiness or barrenness. This is seen in religious texts where God claims all that opens the womb, symbolizing the filling of emptiness.
