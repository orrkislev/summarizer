An Introduction to History of Science and the Emotions // Dror, Hitzer, Laukotter, Leon-Sanz // 2016		
Over the past two or three decades, the study of emotions has revolutionized our conceptions of human nature. What we now call the “Emotional Turn” challenged earlier scientific understandings of humans—our brains, our bodies, and the laws that govern their functions within and between individuals—and of society as a whole. Research on emotions has contributed to the invention of new scientific techniques and instruments, to the development of new ways of seeing and making visible, to the reorganization of the hierarchy of disciplines in science, as well as to the public visibility of and political interest in science.	The "Emotional Turn" over recent decades has reshaped our understanding of human nature, led to new scientific methods and instruments, and heightened public and political interest in science.	Revolution of Emotion Studies
This turn to emotions is now visible in the neurosciences, economics, sociology, anthropology, criminology, philosophy, and literary and media studies. In history, the study of emotions is no longer the lonely enterprise of a marginal avant-garde but a burgeoning, increasingly respected, and established field within historiography. Numerous conferences, dedicated monograph series, and new journals and centers for the study of the history of emotions testify to the success of this new field.	Emotion studies has spread across diverse fields like neurosciences to sociology and has become an established field in historiography, signified by numerous dedicated events and resources.	Emotion Studies' Growth Across Disciplines
But should one follow this new historiographical trend and add a history-of-emotions perspective to the history of science and a history-of-science perspective to the history of emotions? This question is as legitimate as it is rhetorical since this volume testifies to our conviction that the history of emotions can indeed contribute a valuable and challenging perspective to the history of science and that the history of science can significantly enrich the history, sociology, and anthropology of emotions, as well as the study of emotions in the neurosciences.	The idea of integrating a history-of-emotions perspective into the history of science, and vice versa, is deemed valuable and challenging. This approach could enrich the understanding of emotion history, sociology, anthropology, and neuroscience studies.	Interplay of Emotion and Science Histories
One compelling argument in favor of such a perspective lies in the necessary intellectual critique of the present-day viewpoint of science, the need to historicize emotion concepts, to detect alternative but oftentimes marginalized scientific routes into emotion research, and, ultimately, to articulate the complex genealogy of the emotional turn from a history-of-science perspective. This latter history of the science of the present is no less significant for the humanities than it is for the neurosciences because numerous affective theorists and emotion researchers in history, sociology, anthropology, and philosophy draw deliberately or unselfconsciously on the recent neurosciences of emotions in formulating their conceptions and assumptions regarding the emotions. While some criticize the explicit adoption of scientific models of emotions in the humanities and social sciences, others present it as a positive and progressive development in overcoming the abstractions and reductionisms of discourse, incorporating the body into history, and bypassing the Cartesian divide between reason and emotion (mind and body). A critical history of the modern sciences of emotions is thus essential for reflecting on and contextualizing our own assumptions and scholarship, as several contributions to this volume exemplify: be it the recent history of motherly love going schizogenic, as Anne Harrington shows, or the neurophysiological discovery of a “new” post-1945 “supramaximal” “super-pleasure,” which Otniel E. Dror examines.	Integrating history-of-emotions with history-of-science is advantageous. It aids in critiquing contemporary science views, exploring overlooked research paths, and understanding the emotional turn's origin. Despite debates, such integration is seen as a step towards resolving traditional mind-body division and enriching discourse. This is crucial for contextualizing our understanding and research in modern emotion sciences.	Integrating Histories for a Holistic View
But the history of science and the history of emotions can offer each other much more than this important historical inquiry into their respective presents. The history of science can extend the history of emotions by proffering science qua science as a new, even if at first blush unlikely, resource for the study of emotions. It can also expand the very notion of what an emotion is (and what the study of the history of emotions is about) and it can enrich and challenge narratives of emotions, as Piroska Nagy and Damien Boquet demonstrate in this volume by calling into question the grand narrative of scientific emotions as a specifically modern phenomenon. In a reciprocal manner, the history of emotions can provide historians of science with what has been repeatedly demanded during the last decade: a broader perspective on history beyond the scope of micro- or case studies, as well as a more tightly knit integration of the history of science into general history.9 As Robert E. Kohler and Kathryn M. Olesko suggested in a recent Osiris volume, instead of calling for a big-picture history, historians of science should move toward big thinking. Big thinking is a call to “develop the generalities that grow out of and remain rooted in specialized research.”10 Kohler and Olesko rightfully argued that this kind of midscale history entailed a critical reexamination of three historiographical fundamentals: namely, the categories of analysis, the subjects, and, eventually, the periodizations.11 The history of emotions invites historians to rethink and reframe these three historiographical fundamentals.	Beyond examining their respective presents, the history of science and the history of emotions can significantly benefit each other. The history of science can offer a fresh perspective on studying emotions, broaden the understanding of emotions, and challenge prevailing narratives. Conversely, the history of emotions can provide a broader view for science historians, helping to integrate science history into general history. This promotes "big thinking," which requires a reevaluation of fundamental historiographical aspects like analysis categories, subjects, and periodizations, and hence allows historians to reframe these fundamentals.	Mutual Enrichment of Emotion and Science Histories
* * *		
What is the history of emotions about? Are emotions a new analytical category like gender or class (even if very different in kind), or are they a subject of historical analysis in and of themselves, like the senses or pain?12 In the title of his famous 1884 Mind article, William James asked, “What Is an Emotion?” This question is open to historical investigation. Historians of emotions reject essentialist definitions of emotion(s). “Emotion” basically indicates that humans at different times and from different regions, classes, and genders used concepts with many different names to describe a human (sometimes also an animal) faculty that was in some way or another related to the bodily sensations of feeling, touching, and moving, that was more or other than just thoughts, and that was part of the human experience as shared experience and communication. Emotion, in this basic sense, was for most of history’s course regarded as fundamental to human existence and to human action. Recently, scholars have begun to discuss the possible differences between and assumed political significance of “emotions” and “affects.” “Affects”—as theorists like William E. Conolly and Nigel Thrift assume—are bound more closely to the body than emotions, cannot be reduced to discourses, are preconscious and nonintentional, and are thus incompletely understood in rational terms.	The history of emotions is about reevaluating the understanding of emotions as an analytical category or as a subject for historical analysis. Historians of emotions dismiss essentialist definitions and highlight that emotions are complex concepts that vary based on factors like time, region, class, and gender. They focus on describing a human faculty related to sensations of feeling and communication. Recently, distinctions have been made between "emotions" and "affects," with the latter being more tied to the body, preconscious, nonintentional, and less understood in rational terms.	Understanding the Concept of Emotions in History
But in using emotion(s) as an analytical category, historians have to go beyond this basic definition without losing their historical sensitivity to the equivocality of and the conceptual shifts in emotion concepts. Thus, even within a single scientific discipline, various conflicting concepts of “emotions” might have coexisted, as Bettina Hitzer and Pilar Léon-Sanz demonstrate in this volume in their study of psychosomatic cancer medicine in the twentieth century. If emotion is to be as useful a category of historical analysis as gender currently is, it has to be regarded as intelligible; if it is to be historicized, it has to be, at least in part, learned and culturally specific. If emotions remain irrational and arbitrary, they are not fully accessible for historical analysis. In this case, historians can only describe in which way they triggered historical events or decisions. The emotion itself, its internal dynamic, its implications within processes of subjectification, as well as its role in shaping practices and material cultures, would remain opaque. If we regard emotions not as universals, then we might ask how emotions evolve, how they are learned, why they change, and what effects these changes have, a challenge that Felicity Callard takes up in investigating the history of panic disorder in this volume. Only this understanding of emotions allows us to include questions pertaining to historical developments and changes on the individual, social group, and societal levels in the analysis.	Using emotions as an analytical category in history involves acknowledging their complexity and changeability over time and across disciplines. Emotions need to be seen as learned and culturally specific to be useful for historical analysis. A comprehensive understanding of emotions, considering their evolution, learning, changes, and societal impacts, allows for more nuanced historical analysis.	Analytical Value of Emotions in Historical Studies
As a category of analysis sui generis, emotion is not reducible to other categories or forms of historical explanations, and it offers a distinctive prism through which to (re)interpret historical events. It partly constitutes historical developments rather than being (only) derivative. It is, in other words, “a force giving shape to politics, society and culture, to beliefs and values, and to everyday life, institutional settings, and the processes of decision making.”	Emotion serves as a unique, shaping force in history, influencing politics, culture, beliefs, and daily life, offering a distinct lens for interpreting historical events.	Emotion's Role in History
Emotion is not necessarily intentional, nor is it limited to explaining human actions or motivations. But this is, of course, one possibility in using the category “emotion.” It was in this first sense that the history of emotions shifted the historiographical ground by emphasizing agency over causation in historical analysis. What scared people, “what made them joyful or proud or disgusted or compassionate [became] … fundamental to understanding what those same people decided and did.” Taking this route into the history of emotions does not dismiss the possible significance of other elements that determine human agency, since emotions are often part of a complex interplay with political, economic, scientific, or other arguments, as well as pragmatic considerations. The analysis of this complex interweaving is central to many contributions to this volume. Anja Laukötter, for example, highlights how the very constitution of the modern human subject and his or her emotions was negotiated when discussing the psychological underpinnings of health education films.	Emotion, while not always intentional, plays a significant role in understanding human actions and motivations in history. The study of emotions emphasizes agency over causation, making it key to understanding people's decisions and actions. Emotions interact with political, economic, and scientific factors in this context, underlining the need to analyze this intricate interplay, as demonstrated in several contributions to this volume.	Emotion's Influence on Historical Agency
In contrast to psychohistorical narratives, which also regarded emotions as decisive, the new history of emotions presents individual and collective emotions as embedded in social structures and relations and as part of some larger emotional world. Different terms have been coined to exemplify this embeddedness: “structures of feelings” (Raymond Williams), “emotionology” (Peter N. Stearns and Carol Z. Stearns), “emotional regimes” (William M. Reddy), and “emotional communities” (Barbara H. Rosenwein) to name the most important at this point.	The new history of emotions views emotions as deeply intertwined with social structures and communities, using terms like "emotionology" and "emotional regimes" to explain this relationship.	Emotions Embedded in Social Context
Nevertheless, emotions are not determined by these larger frameworks. They leave room for maneuvering, as William Reddy noted in proposing the term “emotive” to explain that for one person emotion statements might serve as a choice between different possible emotional reactions, and for another they are transformative insofar as they change their objects and reflect back on themselves. This performative dimension of emotions also allows us to transcend old dichotomies like “body and language,” privileging dimensions of bodily sensations and senses while suggesting new ways of thinking about the relationship between the individual and the “larger world.”	Emotions have a performative aspect, allowing for choice and transformation despite being influenced by larger structures. This helps bridge gaps between individual sensations and broader societal contexts.	Emotions' Performative Aspect and Freedom
* * *		
Against this preliminary background, we pose the question: What were the historical interrelationships between science and its cultures on the one hand and cultures of emotions on the other? This key historical question harks back to a grand Western narrative that still frames contemporary historiography of science and the emotions. From at least the eighteenth century, numerous commentators observed that science transformed Western emotions. Framing their argument in terms of a progressive narrative of diminishing fear, pain, and wonder in Western societies, they contended that science dispelled “supernatural fears … by the discoveries that reveal the laws of the world,” and brought “man more or less to the position of ‘nil admirari,’” as Alexander Bain argued in The Emotions and the Will (1859). This was the meaning of the Enlightenment, according to Max Horkheimer and Theodor W. Adorno. In Dialektik der Aufklärung, as Michael Hagner has argued, Adorno and Horkheimer “defined the central aim of the enlightenment as ‘delivering humans from fear and installing them as masters.’ … The goal was reached ‘if there is nothing unknown left.’” The Enlightenment established a direct link between the accumulation of knowledge and “overcoming fear.”	There is a historical question about how science and its cultures have interrelated with cultures of emotions. The narrative suggests that from the eighteenth century onwards, science is perceived as having transformed Western emotions by decreasing fear, pain, and wonder. Advocates of this perspective argue that science's discoveries have dispelled supernatural fears and led to a state of less admiration. This concept is illustrated by the Enlightenment's aim of freeing humans from fear through knowledge accumulation.	Science's Influence on Emotion Cultures
This grand historical narrative persisted throughout the nineteenth century and appeared in the writings of John Stuart Mill and William James, among others, and in the diatribes of the critics of science. These critics endorsed the grand narrative of the inverse relationships between science and emotions, but instead of a progressive narrative of diminishing fear and pain, they disparaged science and medicine for diminishing feelings and for the triumph of the head over the heart.	Throughout the nineteenth century, thinkers like John Stuart Mill and critics alike maintained that science reduced emotional intensity, favoring rationality over feelings.	The Evolution of the Grand Narrative
For historians of science and of emotions, this grand Western narrative raises a myriad of historical and methodological questions: To what extent did science, in its multiple diversities and locations, and in its variegated activities, products, theories, and emotions, constitute the norms, experiences, expressions, and regimes of emotions? Is there a grand narrative of the interrelationships between the emotions and science, or between particular emotions and science? Did discrete scientific developments structure the expression, experience, visibility, or nature of emotions? In this vein, Naama Cohen-Hanegbi’s contribution to this volume examines how medical debates about emotions and their treatment by medical means shaped not only the science of medicine itself but also the status of the medical profession and its position in late medieval society. Rafael Mandressi’s contribution addresses these issues in studying how affective cultures were linked to and negotiated by anatomical dissection in Early Modern Europe. Are there basic emotions (or sentiments) that undergird science? What can the study of science, and its emotions, contribute to the history of emotions, beyond the study of emotions in literature, art, economics, and politics?	The narrative of science influencing emotions brings forth many questions. It prompts inquiry into how science shaped norms, experiences, and regimes of emotions, and if specific scientific developments structured the expression or experience of emotions. Other questions explore if there are basic emotions that underpin science and what studying science and its emotions can contribute to the history of emotions compared to other fields like literature, art, economics, and politics.	Questions on Emotions and Science Interactions
The first methodological challenge for the historian pursuing these questions is how to read emotions in, from, and through science. How does the historian identify emotions in a culture that deliberately and methodologically excluded emotions from its texts, narratives, practices, and practitioners, separated the factual-scientific from the personal-experiential, and admonished its members to suppress their blushes, control their disgust reactions, and abolish their tears, at least since the eighteenth century? This latter difficulty partly explains the relative absence of histories of emotions and histories of science that derive their history of emotions from science qua science—from the very fabric of science—and the penchant to seek the disappeared emotions of science in the archives: in the private correspondence, autobiographies, and journal entries of scientists. Literature and art, on the other hand, have very often been presented as privileged sites for the study of cultures and histories of emotions, since they are, as the cultural materialist Raymond Williams put it, the social loci that best manifest the “actually lived through” and are closest to “original experience.”	One challenge for historians is deciphering emotions in a scientific culture that traditionally avoided emotions in its texts, narratives, and practices. This difficulty partially explains why the emotions of science are often sought in archives like private correspondence or journal entries of scientists. In contrast, literature and art are often seen as the most revealing sites for studying cultures and histories of emotions due to their proximity to original experience.	Reading Emotions in Science
Yet emotions suffused science and science suffused emotions. Fundamental aspects of science were undergirded by and can be explained only in terms of the emotions, and fundamental aspects of the emotions were undergirded by and can be explained only in terms of the sciences: the “fear” of the “epistemic fear” that motivated science writ large, the “sentimentalism” of the “sentimental empiricism” of eighteenth-century knowledge, the “sentiment” of the “sentiment of objectivity,” the “wonder” of scientific epistemology, and the “laughter” or “seriousness” of science—all have a history of emotions. Conversely, the “fear” of early twentieth-century Russian soldiers, the “excitement” of the football game, the category of survivor’s “shame,” the very concept of “emotion” (rather than “passion”), and even our contemporary scholarship of the history (anthropology and sociology) of emotions—all have a history of science.	Emotions are integral to science and science to emotions. Fundamental aspects of science, like 'fear' in epistemic fear or 'wonder' in scientific epistemology, have a history rooted in emotions. Conversely, many emotional aspects like the 'fear' of Russian soldiers or the concept of 'emotion' itself, have a history grounded in science.	Emotions and Science: A Two-Way Relationship
These different and variegated emotions are not always visible or apparent in terms of ostensible “emotions.” Conversely, ostensibly expressed “emotions” are not always (or have not always been) interpreted in terms of emotions. These ignored and dismissed emotions were often expressed by scientists. William James had written of the “thrill” of newly discovered ideas, Alexander Bain analyzed the “excitement” of “chasing” after knowledge, Elie de Cyon described the “ecstasy” of science, and Walter B. Cannon compared his mountaineering experiences to his experiences inside the laboratory. Historians, however, have often interpreted these expressed emotions of scientists and physicians in ways that dismissed them as emotions. These emotions, as Hilary Rose observed with respect to aggression and anger, have become so “normalized within science that the dominant discourse no longer recognizes them as emotions.” Other historians have argued that the ostensibly expressed emotions of scientists either depict the scientist as courageous, honorable, heroic, or masculine or present the tribulations, pain, and suffering that the scientist must endure in pursuing science and producing knowledge. Still others have intellectualized the scientist’s emotions.	Emotions expressed by scientists have been largely underrepresented or misinterpreted in historical accounts. Despite scientists' emotional descriptions of their experiences, historians often dismiss these emotions as irrelevant or reframe them as courage or masculinity, thus overlooking an integral part of the scientific endeavor.	Unveiling the Hidden Emotions in Scientific Pursuits
But should one accept this emotion-denying perspective, or should the historian study the ways and means through which scientists expressed their emotions, perhaps in other terms and/or through alternative mediums and/or in terms of other kinds of emotions? These other kinds and mediums of emotions may not be immediately recognizable because they did not appear in terms of commonsense notions of emotions or in terms of psychological, literary, or artistic emotions. They were not necessarily manifest in overt actions, in ostensible locutions, expressions, or behaviors of emotions, or in terms of conation and motivation.	Scientific work may carry non-traditional emotional expressions, urging historians to explore these elusive forms.	Unseen Emotions in Science
These emotions, for example, could be manifest in terms of the exchange, mutual exhibition, and circulation of graphs and/or numerical tables of one’s own embodiments among members of the scientific community (who recognized them as emotions), hand in hand with the exclusion of any direct reference to one’s nameable emotions. These were the emotions of communities of scientists during the late nineteenth century. Are they “less than” or “not” an emotion vis-à-vis a nameable emotion—such as “fear” or “anxiety”? What are the meaningful distinctions between manifesting emotions in terms of these graphs and mediums versus the nameable emotion (or the overt action and expression)? The inclusion of these emotions extends the identities of emotions and the possibilities for histories, anthropologies, and sociologies of (these) emotions. It also presents alternative readings of the history of emotions and a different arrangement of the historical periodization of the emotions. Conversely, the nameable emotion in science could indicate something that we do not conceive of or identify as an emotion. During the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the named emotions of “jealousy,” “anxiety,” or “apprehension,” for example, encompassed and gave meaning to a variety of disruptive laboratory and clinical events—all of which were subsumed under nameable emotions. Physiologists and clinicians invoked “emotion” in observing numerous unexpected and, from their perspective, disruptive events. These events included anything from an unexpected shift in blood pressure (during a blood pressure measurement), to a variety of pathological-like clinical findings (such as an elevated glucose level), to failures to replicate experiments. These inexplicable and disturbing moments inside the laboratory and clinic were articulated in terms of the language of emotions—by arguing that an emotion had infiltrated—was present inside—the laboratory or clinic. These invocations of emotions extended the possible meanings of nameable emotions, as well as assumptions about their corporeal expression, about the impact they had on the body, and about the way one could influence, control, or manage them. These invocations extend the reach of the history of emotions.	Emotions in science may not always be traditionally recognizable. They can appear in the exchange and interpretation of graphs or numerical data. Conversely, common emotions like "anxiety" can be invoked to explain unexpected results in scientific work. Understanding these aspects can enrich the history of emotions.	Graphs as Emotional Artifacts 
Scientific technologies also extend the reach of the history of emotions because scientists designed into scientific technologies aspects of the affective logic of their societies. Late nineteenth-century scientific instruments, which represented a mechanical objectivity that erased feelings, also implicitly embodied a hypersensitivity and reactivity. On the one hand, these scientific technologies embodied the contemporary masculine emotional culture of self-control and restraint, and, on the other hand, they embodied a contemporary feminine emotional culture of sensitivity and feelings—of the female Sensitive. The attributes that explained (away) the female Sensitive’s ability to “read” people were designed into the instruments. The instruments, like the Sensitive, worked by touching the body of the subject and detecting minute movements, which indicated shifts in emotions. The instruments embodied and negotiated these masculine and feminine facets of the culture of emotions in their very design and mechanisms. Pervasive moods or structures of feelings were also embodied in particular disease entities and laboratory models, as were, we suggest, scientific texts. In turn, scientific texts, models, and technologies generated emotions in different communities, like the antivivisectionists, but no less so in the investigators and, ultimately, in those who were measured, tested, and treated using these instruments and therapies.	Late 19th-century scientific instruments were designed to reflect societal emotional logic. They embodied a masculine culture of self-control and a feminine culture of sensitivity, paralleling the contemporary gendered emotional norms. These instruments, detecting minute body movements, mirrored the emotional structures of their time, thereby extending the historical understanding of emotions.	Scientific Technologies and Emotion
By reading these technologies, disease entities, laboratory models, and scientific texts for their emotions, historians of emotions and of science can study the broader affective logic that was designed into these entities and that partly structured and constituted them, and they can interpret aspects of these technologies, disease entities, laboratory models, and texts in terms of the culture of emotions that partly shaped them. They can also study the emotions that were generated by these technologies, disease entities, laboratory models, and texts and their significance for science qua science and for cultures of emotions. These different readings can reveal how the inadequacies and limitations of laboratory models and research practices can be crucial in shaping a specific scientific understanding of emotions, as Eric Engstrom argues in his study of the late nineteenth-century psychiatrist Emil Kraepelin’s research on affective disorders.	By examining technologies, disease models, and scientific texts, historians can uncover the emotional logic designed into them. This study can reveal the emotions generated by scientific activities, and their impact on the understanding of science and emotional cultures. It can also highlight how limitations in research practices can shape scientific understanding of emotions.	Interpreting Emotions in Scientific Practices
The generation of emotions in and by scientific texts, models, and technologies also suggests that we should extend the cerebral concept of “virtual witnessing” to include a new concept: “virtual feeling.” This term conveys the re-creation of the feelings/experiences of the experimenter inside the laboratory and/or of the adventurer explorer in the readers of scientific texts. The emotions of the experimenter inside the laboratory or of the field scientist were crucial to these endeavors and encounters. They raise the further question of whether historians, in following and modifying the model set by Otto Sibum in a different context and with other objectives in mind, should attempt to re-create the emotions of past experiments and experimenters.	This refers to re-creating the experimenter's feelings/experiences through scientific texts, suggesting the pivotal role of emotions in science and its historical study.	Virtual Feeling in Science
* * *		
Envisaging the emotions of past experiments and experimenters also entails taking the emotions of a different but not less important community into consideration whose emotions have often been obfuscated and invisible in histories of science or emotions: the emotions of animals. Historians of emotions have thus far provided meager tools for incorporating animal emotions into history: as part of our human histories and as part of their histories. Many of the dominant concepts and methodologies in the history of emotions—including emotional communities, emotional regimes, emotional styles, emotives, and emotionology—are strictly anthropocentric. They exclude the emotions of animals and the history of animal emotions from histories of emotions. In the history of emotions writ large, animal emotions are arguably the most significant absent other in what is largely and predominantly a history of human emotions. This absence is particularly evident to historians of science, since historians of science encounter animals and their emotions in numerous contexts and scientific texts. Animals and their emotions, moreover, provided the early foundations for our contemporary science of the neurophysiology of (human) emotions, which also partly shapes our own scholarship in the history (and anthropology and sociology) of emotions.	The absence of animal emotions in historical narratives is notable, as it calls for a less anthropocentric approach to the study of emotions and science. Given animals' crucial role in shaping our understanding of neurophysiology of emotions, their emotional histories should be included in broader narratives of emotion history.	Animal Emotions in Historical Perspective
Exploring animal emotions in scientific settings also opens up a different conceptual perspective on emotion in general, for emotions are not necessarily the reason for (not) doing or deciding (not) to do something. They are often an integral part of the (non)actions themselves, accompanying and molding them in a noncausal or nonintentional way. They do not have to give an answer to the question why something is done but to the question how something is done and what the action signifies. Using the concept of an “emotional habitus,” emotions are understood as embodied or even as an emotional disposition. This more Bourdieuan approach to emotion history emphasizes the role of the body in producing and sustaining emotions through practices—and in doing so it links the bodily dimensions with the socially and culturally constructed dimension of emotions. This methodological assumption underpins Dolores Martín-Moruno’s essay in this volume. Martín-Moruno analyzes the nineteenth-century physiologist Paolo Mantegazza, whose study of pain included laboratory research, as well as photographic studies.	Emotions are often not just the reasons for actions but an integral part of actions themselves, shaping them noncausally. A more Bourdieuan approach to the history of emotions emphasizes the role of the body in producing and sustaining emotions through practices, linking the bodily dimensions with socially and culturally constructed dimensions of emotions. Such a perspective opens up a different conceptual understanding of emotions in general.	Emotions as an Integral Part of Actions
Especially with regard to the history of science, one could ask whether emotional practices could be conceived of as something similar to what Ludwik Fleck had defined as “styles of thinking” (Denkstile) and “collectivities of thinking” (Denkkollektive) that characterize and convey the way a certain scientific group constructs, investigates, and verifies its research. Fleck himself had conceded that emotions cannot be regarded as separate from these styles of thinking. According to Fleck there is no “emotionless state” as there is no “rationality as such.” The entire process of scientific research (from observation to explanation) and the epistemic interest of the scientist were regarded by Fleck as driven by emotions.	Drawing on Ludwik Fleck's concept of "styles of thinking" and "collectivities of thinking", one might consider emotional practices as a similar concept within the history of science. Fleck argued that emotions cannot be divorced from these thinking styles, rejecting the notion of an "emotionless state" and asserting that the process of scientific research is driven by emotions.	Emotional Practices as Styles of Thinking in Science
But postulating the existence of emotional styles in science (and elsewhere) means more than the occurrence of specific emotions at specific moments in the process of scientific research and theory construction. Thus, it is not only about modifying a perspective or highlighting a previously underestimated step within the Denkstil concept. Nor is it solely about including emotions as one more or less decisive element within researching and explaining the production of knowledge. Certainly, the role of emotions within this process can and should be approached by investigating the emotional style that is dominant within a certain scientific field or setting and asking whether and how this style constituted knowledge production.	Considering the emotional styles prevalent within a specific scientific field can offer insights into how these styles contribute to the production of knowledge. It's a departure from focusing solely on individual emotions, instead considering the collective emotional landscape within a scientific domain.	Emotional Styles in Scientific Knowledge Production
The concept of emotional style that is propagated here goes beyond this rather limited accessory role of emotions within the production of knowledge. It aims at a specific emotional haltung—an ethos, mindset, and attitude—that the researcher of a certain group, discipline, or science in general had internalized and is reenacting every time he or she is doing research. This emotional style can be multifaceted and can determine how the researcher deals with emotions in general or with specific ones, how he or she acts and interacts, and what techniques or instruments he or she uses. It is tied to and trained through practices and techniques that are part of his or her field. It is usually not limited to the narrow confines of a specific scientific setting. The emotional style, moreover, is not emotional in the conventional meaning of the word; that is, it is not necessarily emphatically emotional nor does it necessarily emphasize certain expressive emotions or emotionality as such. Emotional styles are thus not only intersubjective phenomena but—one could argue—they are part of an interobjectivity that is related to the interplay of humans, artifacts, and spaces. Thus, Jessica Riskin’s “sentimental empiricism,” Lorraine Daston and Peter Galison’s “objectivity,” and Amir Alexander’s “tragic” mathematics can all be interpreted as emotional styles.	The concept of 'emotional style' moves beyond individual emotions to consider an ethos or mindset a researcher embodies during the scientific process. This style, which influences how a researcher interacts with emotions and their method of work, is tied to the practices and techniques of their field. Importantly, 'emotional style' isn't necessarily overtly expressive or traditionally emotional; it represents the intersubjective and interobjective elements within scientific settings. Concepts like 'sentimental empiricism', 'objectivity', or 'tragic mathematics' can be interpreted as unique emotional styles.	Interplay of Emotional Styles and Scientific Knowledge
These emotional styles interrelate with broader emotional cultures in multitudinous ways. They might conflict or coexist with, be influenced by, or impact other coeval emotional styles—both scientific and extrascientific. They might even shape or contribute to shaping a new emotional style of Science in general, and they might explain shifts and changes in emotional styles in other arenas of society.	Emotional styles in science interact dynamically with broader societal cultures. These styles can mutually influence or reshape emotional dynamics both within scientific circles and wider society.	Emotional Styles' Societal Interplay
One brief example illustrates this latter possibility and the potential for rewriting aspects of the history of science and of the history of emotions by examining the interrelations between emotional styles in science and broader cultures of emotions, in proposing an integrated history of a science-emotions perspective. Over a decade ago, historian of emotions Peter Stearns identified a broad shift in the emotionology— “attitudes or standards that a society, or a definable group within a society, maintains toward basic emotions and their appropriate expression”—of late Victorian (mostly US) society. One major feature of this emergent emotionology was a significant shift to an emphasis on emotional control and discipline. Stearns demonstrated that this “cool”-restraint emotionology dominated a wide range of social loci, one of which was science. The control and discipline of emotions in late nineteenth-century science was thus a product of the internalization of this broader cool emotionology of Western society. Historians of science, on the other hand, have demonstrated that the control over emotions in science was one element in a longer history of scientific objectivity. This history of scientific objectivity harked back to the seventeenth century. It preceded, rather than followed, the late Victorian shift to a cool emotionology.	Historian Peter Stearns pointed out a shift in late Victorian society towards a focus on emotional control and discipline. This trend also permeated the scientific community, aligning with the long-standing tradition of scientific objectivity dating back to the seventeenth century. Therefore, the internalization of societal emotional norms in the scientific realm suggests a close interrelation between wider societal emotions and scientific practices.	Emotionology and Science
These two divergent narratives, which draw on the history of emotions and on the history of science, suggest several new hypotheses that revise both narratives. One hypothesis privileges the history-of-science perspective but integrates it into recent models of historical change that draw on the history-of-emotions literature. According to this first interpretation, the shift to a cool emotionology during the late nineteenth century reflected the progressive dominance of the “emotional community” of scientists in late Victorian society. It exemplifies one mechanism of change, in which one emotional community—science in this case—comes to dominate in a particular society at a particular moment in time. This first alternate reading of late nineteenth-century emotions can enrich and/or offer a possible alternative to Stearns’s history-of-emotions narrative of late Victorian society.	The increased emphasis on emotional restraint in the late 19th century could reflect the growing influence of the scientific community. This new interpretation challenges traditional narratives of emotional history during this period.	Emotional Shifts in Late Victorian Society
Stearns’s identification of a cool emotionology as a general feature of late Victorian society in turn complicates the history-of-science narrative. It challenges historians of science to heed the synchronic emotional contexts of the relationships between emotions and science, rather than to heed primarily the diachronic history-of-scientific-objectivity narrative. It suggests that historians of science have omitted a major factor in the history of scientific objectivity and that the history of objectivity should be rewritten to include the perspective of the history-of-emotions narrative and the emotional contexts of science.	Recognizing a 'cool emotionology' during the late Victorian era questions the diachronic view of scientific objectivity's history. The emotional contexts of science must be taken into account, leading to a revision of the history of scientific objectivity through the lens of emotional history.	Rewriting the History of Scientific Objectivity
For both historians of emotions and historians of science, this history indicates that late nineteenth-century science is the ideal locus for studying and characterizing the dominant culture of emotions during this particular period. Science, maybe even more than art or literature, best manifested (and was perhaps the harbinger of) the cool emotionology. The study of the history of science is the study of the history of emotions, and vice versa.	The study of 19th century science history illuminates the dominant 'cool emotionology' of that era, suggesting a deep link between the evolution of science and emotional culture.	Science and Emotions Intersect
* * *		
Each contribution to this volume exemplifies the historiographical work of emotion—what can a history-of-emotions approach offer historians of science/medicine/technology? What new insights become available with the inclusion of “emotion” as an analytical category? What is a history of emotions in science? The essays are arranged under three major headings: Situating Emotions, Emotions into Practice, and New Emotions–New Knowledge–New Subjectivities. Many of the essays exemplify multiple dimensions of emotions and could fit under more than one major heading. The essays study developments in the history of technology and the human sciences (medicine, physiology, and psychiatry) on two different continents (North America and Europe) between the twelfth and the twentieth centuries. They exemplify the work that emotions can do for historians studying different periods, geographical areas, and disciplines.	This volume seeks to understand the role of emotions in the history of science, medicine, and technology. It is divided into three main sections: Situating Emotions, Emotions into Practice, and New Emotions–New Knowledge–New Subjectivities. Each essay delves into different periods, geographical areas, and disciplines, illustrating how the study of emotions can provide new insights into historical events and developments.	Exploring Emotions in Science History
 Situating Emotions 		
The contributions by Piroska Nagy and Damien Boquet, Naama Cohen-Hanegbi, Bettina Hitzer and Pilar León-Sanz, and Anne Harrington explore the ways in which medical and scientific communities approached and explained the functions of emotions and the concomitant positioning of emotions in and/or between body-mind intersubjectivity. In Nagy and Boquet’s contribution, emotions serve as a common platform for bridging the medieval history of Christianity and the modern history of science. By drawing on the “religious” history of “passions,” Nagy and Boquet address and redress the “scientific” history of modern emotions. They examine how Western thinking about emotions from the beginning of the twelfth century engaged new questions and received a new form and how emotions became an integral part of “human nature.” Cohen-Hanegbi argues that an attention to emotions as an analytical category promotes a more contextualized reading of science, particularly in those historiographical enclaves where contextualization is still very much lacking. She fills a gap in late medieval history by approaching emotions in terms of medicine. She charts the contributions of scientific and medical thought to the formation of the late medieval culture of emotions. In this context, she also examines shifts in medical authority and the tensions between medicine as art and medicine as science in relation to the new authority over emotions. The contribution by Hitzer and León-Sanz presents a cross-Atlantic study of psychosomatic medicine in Germany and the United States in terms of distinct shifts in emotions. They study the introduction of new ideas with respect to the emotional body and the emotional self in psychosomatic medicine, which emerged between 1920 and 1960, and through a case study of cancer. They trace a significant shift in cancer: from an early twentieth-century organic conception of malignant cells, which was impervious to the influence of emotions, to a psychosomatic conception, which took off from emotions, over the course of the twentieth century. Their essay illuminates how and why this change occurred rather late in Germany and how the shift in Germany was influenced by the earlier turn toward framing cancer psychosomatically in the United States. Harrington’s contribution charts a grand historical narrative of motherly love and of schizophrenia during the twentieth century. Her study weaves the history of motherly love and schizophrenia into a genealogy of major shifts in the conceptualization of emotions. She demonstrates how, during the period after World War II, the meandering history of motherly love and that of schizophrenia converged, creating the emblematic figure of the “Schizophrenogenic Mother.”	This volume explores how scientific and medical communities have historically conceptualized emotions. Nagy and Boquet link emotions from a medieval religious perspective to the modern scientific viewpoint. Cohen-Hanegbi explores the role of emotions in late medieval medical history. Hitzer and León-Sanz track the changing understanding of cancer from a purely biological condition to one influenced by emotions. Harrington explores the 20th-century interconnection between the concept of motherly love and schizophrenia.	Emotions in Science and Medicine: A Historical Examination
 Emotions into Practice 		
The contributions by Rafael Mandressi, Dolores Martín-Moruno, Eric J. Engstrom, and Anja Laukötter illustrate ways in which emotions infused practices and practices generated emotions. Mandressi examines how an attention to emotions affords new interpretations of scientific developments that are beyond the study of “emotions.” Mandressi draws on the concept of “emotional communities” in explicitly challenging the history of medical professionalization during the early modern period. He examines how the shift to the dead body, with the emergence of the practice of anatomical dissection during the thirteenth century, had significant affective implications. The attention to the administration of affects, in turn, was important for the professional identity of practitioners and for their social status. Anatomy in early modern Europe was a significant locus “where affective cultures were produced and negotiated among several professional and social groups.” Martín-Moruno’s contribution juxtaposes three interrelated developments that converged on pain. By positioning pain as her organizing principle, she links between shifts in cultures of pain, the development of a science of pain, and the changing persona of the scientist during the nineteenth century. Martín-Moruno’s contribution suggests how an attention to pain closes the gap between macro transformations in cultures of pain and micro productions of knowledge inside the laboratory. Engstrom’s article emphasizes how the intractability of emotion as an object of knowledge and praxis was instrumental for the emergence of new knowledge and new emotions. Engstrom studies Emil Kraepelin’s efforts to account for the significance of emotions in psychiatric illnesses. The failure to scientize emotions drove the research on affective disorders and decisively shaped one of the most influential psychiatric nosologies of the twentieth century. Laukötter’s article examines how films on health education evolved as a specific “emotional engineering technique” to shape not only adults’ emotions and behaviors but also the emotional and intellectual development of pupils in the classroom. Focusing on Germany and the United States in the first decades of the twentieth century, the essay explores how this practice of influencing through the visible was generated through various scientific fields, such as medicine and hygiene as well as psychology and pedagogy.	The chapters by Mandressi, Martín-Moruno, Engstrom, and Laukötter detail how emotions influence practices and generate emotional responses in various fields. Mandressi explores the affective implications of anatomical dissection and its impact on professional identity during the early modern period. Martín-Moruno studies the intersections of cultural shifts around pain, the development of pain science, and the changing persona of scientists in the nineteenth century. Engstrom looks at Kraepelin's work on affective disorders in psychiatry and how failure to scientifically explain emotions shaped psychiatric nosologies. Lastly, Laukötter explores health education films as a method of emotional engineering, shaping the emotional development and behaviors of adults and pupils in the early twentieth century in Germany and the United States.	Emotions and Practices in Science and Medicine
New Emotions–New Knowledge–New Subjectivities		
The contributions by Felicity Callard and Otniel E. Dror study how new and emerging identities of and criteria for emotions created new knowledge and new subjectivities, and vice versa. Callard’s contribution examines the emergence of a new category of emotion within the study of emotions—the “panic disorder.” Callard draws on this new emotion in order to extend the historiographical focus on organizational, institutional, societal, and professional changes in the history of psychiatry to a focus on how and why the very shape, texture, and experience of symptoms, affects, and behaviors variously positioned within the purview of psychiatry and its proximate domains changed. Dror’s contribution studies the discovery of a “new” post–World War II “supramaximal” “super-pleasure.” Dror studies the laboratory enactments that constituted this new pleasure as “supramaximal,” instant, and insatiable and suggests several postwar contexts that situate the new pleasure. He also reflects on—in introducing—an approach that “sides with” emotion, presents the notion of a “missed” emotion, and considers the meanings of “repetitions”—for science and for pleasure.	Callard and Dror's contributions focus on new emotions and their impact on knowledge and self-perception. Callard delves into the emergence of "panic disorder" as a category within psychiatry, affecting the understanding of symptoms and behaviors. Dror investigates the post-WWII identification of "supramaximal" pleasure, exploring its implications for scientific understanding and the notion of pleasure itself.	Novel Emotions and Insights in Science and Medicine
These diverse case studies argue for and provide exemplifications of the benefits and insights that become available in the dialogue between the history of emotions and the history of science. The reciprocal interchange between these histories can lead us to rethink our categories of analysis, our subjects, and our periodizations. The ten studies assembled here, which span several centuries, continents, and scientific disciplines, provide a preliminary map and guide for future endeavors. We hope that this volume will stimulate further research that combines the history of science and the history of emotions.	The collection provides a rich dialogue between the history of emotions and science, encouraging a rethink of analysis categories, subjects, and timeframes. It serves as a comprehensive guide for future research that aims to merge these historical areas.	Enriching Histories: Bridging Emotions and Science
